<strong>Posted</strong>: 9/11/22 | September 11th, 2022</p>
<p><em>I get a lot of questions from female readers about safety in Egypt. That&#8217;s not really something I can answer. After all, I only know what female friends tell me. I&#8217;m not an expert so, today, Monica Chapon from <a href="https://thisrareearth.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This Rare Earth</a>, is going to share her experience and advice for staying safe as a solo female traveler in Egypt!</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/save-money-egypt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Egypt</a> sits at the top of so many travelers’ bucket lists for good reason. With such a long history, iconic ancient sites, and exotic smells, tastes, and sounds, it’s easy to understand why.</p>
<p>However, many never actually make it here, due to safety concerns. After all, anyone living in Western countries has likely seen repeated warnings via the government and news stories in the media. </p>
<p><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/egypt-travel-advisory.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The US Department of State</a> warns travelers to &#8220;reconsider travel to Egypt due to terrorism.&#8221; <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/egypt.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Canadian government</a> recommends visitors &#8220;exercise a high degree of caution in Egypt due to the unpredictable security situation and the threat of terrorism.&#8221; </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/africa/egypt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Australian government’s advice</a> is to &#8220;reconsider your need to travel to Egypt overall.&#8221; And, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/egypt/safety-and-security" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UK government</a> cautions that &#8220;terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt.&#8221;</p>
<p>With so many governments warning travelers not to go, I certainly understand the hesitation that people, particularly women, have about visiting Egypt — either solo or as part of a <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-tour-companies-egypt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">group tour around Egypt</a>.</p>
<p>Before heading there, I was definitely on the receiving end of several “are you sure that’s a good idea?” looks. More than once, I was told that I wouldn’t be allowed to walk around without a male chaperone, or that I would most certainly be kidnapped. (Even after coming back safe and sound, people close to me still questioned my choice to go it alone.)</p>
<p>While I knew these worries were exaggerated, I’ll admit I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I got there. After all, with blonde hair and green eyes, I had no chance of blending in or looking like a local. </p>
<p>But I found the Egyptian people to be warm and welcoming. The women offered friendly smiles on the street, and the men I interacted with genuinely wanted me to fall in love with their country, no strings attached.</p>
<p>Now that I have traveled around Egypt solo, I’m here to share what I’ve learned with all the other women out there.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about women’s safety before you go.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Scams and Hassles</h3>
<p><img alt="A solo female traveler posing in the desert of Egypt at dusk" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/egyptsafety3.jpg" width="675" /><br />
While it’s important to note that most Egyptians that I met were absolutely welcoming and kind, Egypt does have a bit of a reputation for tourist scams. Some of the most common I heard about centered around some of the major sights, like the Pyramids. </p>
<p>For example, the men who offer camel rides there are often reported to load tourists onto the camels first, and then once the ride has started, quote a highly inflated price for a short ride. Or vendors will hand you an item as a “gift,” but when you start to walk away, they will hassle you for not paying.</p>
<p>Never accept a camel ride, a taxi ride, or any item without first agreeing to a price.</p>
<p>I ran into a few scams and hassles myself, and the underlying theme of each of them was pressure. Feeling pressured into anything as a solo female can be a daunting experience.</p>
<p>One example of this was with a local driver. I had hired him to take me to a few stops when other modes of transportation were not going to work (more on those below).</p>
<p>The entire time I spent with him was fine. However, as the day was winding down, he started to pressure me to tip more than I already had and then got very pushy about leaving a positive review for him.</p>
<p>This went on for close to an hour. His voice was raised and he was clearly agitated that I was not complying. He went so far as to follow me into my hotel lobby, and proceeded to sit down to wait right there “until I left him a review.” </p>
<p>Since it was a public place with several staff members buzzing around, I didn’t exactly feel unsafe. But as a solo female, I am never okay with a man following me, and I was on high alert.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, I stood my ground more firmly and didn’t comply. He eventually left without further issue, but I’m not sure he would have done that to a man to begin with. </p>
<p>If you find yourself in a situation where someone is trying to pressure you into anything — be it paying or tipping or going somewhere you don’t wish to go — stand your ground. Stay calm and enlist the help of others if necessary. You have every right to refuse anything you know is incorrect or that you don’t wish to take part in.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Getting Around</h3>
<p><img alt="A solo female traveler posing near the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/egyptsafety6.jpg" width="675" /><br />
If you are a woman traveling alone to Egypt, you may have concerns about how you can get around safely. And, I get it: venturing out alone on public transportation can be scary. Here are the best options and how to use each of them safely.</p>
<p>One cheap and reliable mode in Cairo is the metro. Women may want to take advantage of the female-only cabins to avoid unwanted attention. These are typically either the first and second cars or the fourth and fifth cars and will be indicated by signage on the platform.</p>
<p>However, while easy to navigate, the metro does not stop at all the places you may need to go as a tourist. For example, you can’t get to the Pyramids or the Cairo International Airport on the metro alone. That’s where other options come in.</p>
<p><a href="https://thisrareearth.com/uber-in-egypt-cairo-alexandria-hurghada-and-more/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Certain cities, like Cairo and Alexandria, have rideshare apps like Careem and Uber</a>. I found this to be the best and cheapest alternative when bouncing around the city’s sights alone. I also like that they provide a digital record of every driver who picked me up, just in case anything were to go awry.</p>
<p>Taxis and private drivers are an easy option if you are outside the larger cities or if the wait times for rideshares aren’t convenient. For the most part, I found them to be reasonably priced, but make sure you agree on a fare before getting in.</p>
<p>I walked around Cairo quite a bit by myself, too, mindful to dress conservatively. Whether it was through the streets of Islamic Cairo or just to the grocery store, I felt completely safe. </p>
<p>I mostly walked alone in the daylight, though — rarely at night — so I can’t say whether that would have changed my experience. If you plan to be out late at night, I highly recommend that you arrange a taxi or rideshare instead.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sexual Harassment in Egypt</h3>
<p><img alt="Monica, a solo traveler, sitting in the desert in Egypt posing for a photo" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/egyptsafety7.jpg" width="675" /><br />
I would be lying if I said that sexual harassment doesn’t exist in Egypt. It does exist, but it may be less common than you think. I had been mentally prepared for the worst of it: constant catcalls from men, being followed, being harassed. Frankly, I’ve experienced all of these on my travels before. Heck, I’ve experienced them all at home, too.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised when I encountered almost none of this in Egypt. But I know that many women do.</p>
<p>So what should you do if it does happen?</p>
<p>If you experience something like catcalling, I usually find it best to just ignore, ignore, ignore. They typically give up once you’re out of earshot. If in a public setting, or if you feel threatened, you can duck into a store or bring attention to the situation with a loud and strong “No.”</p>
<p>If anything serious happens, such as theft or assault, report it to the tourist police immediately. It is their job to make sure that tourists in Egypt are safe, and they are much more likely to speak English than other officers. They can be reached by dialing 126.</p>
<p>Note that there are also police stationed at many of the main tourist attractions, like the Pyramids. </p>
<p>You can also seek help from your hotel desk or driver. Most Egyptians will gladly step up.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tips to Avoid Being a Target</h3>
<p><img alt="The iconic Sphynx statue in Egpy" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/egyptsafety2.jpg" width="675" /><br />
I suspect that things went so smoothly for me in Egypt partially due to the fact that I felt comfortable there. I’ve traveled around the Middle East quite a bit, so I sort of “get” the culture.</p>
<p>Here are my top tips for women who want to travel to Egypt:</p>
<p><strong>1. Be aware of the cultural norms in Egypt</strong>. This probably won’t come as a surprise, but you should <a href="https://thisrareearth.com/what-to-wear-in-egypt-a-packing-list-for-women/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wear conservative clothing</a> here, even in the hot summer. Think of long pants and shirts that are not too revealing. If I wear tighter leggings, I pair them with a loose shirt that covers my waist and hips. Have a headscarf on hand for certain religious sites, like mosques. (The only place I would personally wear shorts or a tank top would be near the beach resorts.) Even if I see other women dressing more casually, I treat it as a sign of respect for their culture not to do so. And I think this has served me well as a solo traveler.</p>
<p><strong>2. Carry yourself with confidence</strong>. If you don’t feel 100% confident, my advice would be to fake it a little bit. Keep your chin and eyes up. Know where your destination is before you leave your hotel or hostel. This is easy to do by either downloading offline maps or buying a local SIM card; I recommend either Vodafone or Etisalat, which can be bought upon arrival at the Cairo airport.</p>
<p><strong>3. Don’t be afraid to say no</strong>. Also, never feel like you need to stop and talk to be polite. Shopkeepers, restaurant owners, and vendors at tourist sites will be vying for your attention frequently. A firm but polite “Laa, shukran” (no, thank you) as you continue walking is all you need to say if you’re not interested. </p>
<p><strong>4. Watch your purses and cameras</strong>. Most petty theft is a crime of opportunity. Choose cross-body bags, which are harder to snatch, and don’t hand your camera to anyone you don’t trust to return it. Make sure you <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-travel-insurance-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">buy travel insurance</a> too.</p>
<p><strong>5. Avoid political demonstrations</strong>. These have a history of getting out of hand in Egypt. Things were quiet when I was there, but if you hear of any protests or demonstrations, steer clear.</p>
<p>I think a healthy balance of respect and self-assurance works wonders, and this has kept me safe both in Egypt and across the globe. It’s also important to highlight some of the warm and welcoming experiences I had in Egypt, too, which were far greater in number than the incidents above.</p>
<p>For example, I was treated to koshary, Egypt’s national dish and a popular street food, in a completely friendly and platonic way. I got to explore a Bedouin’s home village in the desert. And a hotel worker went above and beyond for me as I was headed to the airport for my departure. Locals were repeatedly friendly, welcoming, and helpful, without even being asked.</p>
<p>I had many more positive experiences than negative ones, with no expectation of anything in return. And in my opinion, my negative experiences were not that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Egypt was more than I could have hoped for. I would wholeheartedly return again without hesitation!</p>
<p><center>***</center></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/save-money-egypt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Egypt</a> can be a completely safe destination for solo female travelers. I’m not saying there won’t be any challenges or hassles — you will likely run into a few. But I also believe that you will find the Egyptian culture, and Egyptian men in general, to be very welcoming. They genuinely want you to love their country. If you come prepared and keep your wits about you, I believe you will.</p>

<h4>Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>
<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />
Find a cheap flight by using <a href="https://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/214481/1027991/13416?subId1=%26currency%3DUSD&#038;associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.com%2F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a>.

<p><strong>Book Your Accommodation</strong><br />
You can book your hostel with <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hostelworld</a>.

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget Travel Insurance</strong><br />
Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It&#8217;s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I&#8217;ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance/?referenceID=24768462&#038;campaign=footer-blue-box&#038;utm_source=24768462&#038;utm_medium=Ambassador" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SafetyWing</a> (best for everyone)

<strong>Posted</strong>: 9/20/22 | September 20th, 2022</p>
<p>The first time I traveled by myself, I went on an organized tour. I was in my early twenties and didn’t know the first thing about travel and I was a bit too afraid to go on my own. So, I booked a tour so that I could travel with other people and have a guide to lean on and help me adjust.</p>
<p>It was exactly what I needed. After that, I was hooked on travel.</p>
<p>Now, even though I am an &#8220;expert,&#8221; I still go on tours because they are super fun, a great way to meet people, an educational way to learn from an informed guide, and they allow you to go to places you normally can’t go alone. They give you time to adjust to the destination and, if you&#8217;re new to travel, to the &#8220;travel lifestyle&#8221; itself.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, we’ve been running tours again as part of <a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Nomadic Network</a>, our community events platform.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve traveled through Western Europe, Romania, Jordan, and Oaxaca, Mexico! (In fact, I’ll be returning to Oaxaca in two weeks for our second tour.)</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/tours" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we’re announcing all our 2023 offerings</a> (which include a bunch of new destinations too!).</p>
<p><a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/tours/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TNN Tours</a> are for people who want to travel — not just vacation — with other members of this community. They are for those who want to meet locals who will show you what it’s like to live in each destination, and for travelers who want to learn from experts about the cuisine, culture, and history of the places you’re visiting.</p>
<p><img alt="A group TNN tour posing for a photo after exploring Jordan together" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/jordan8.jpeg" width="675" /></p>
<p>You’ll get to do bucket-list-worthy activities, have meals in residents’ homes, and see hidden, out-of-the-way spots not normally found on other group tours. On these tours, we mean to get you beyond the tourist traps.</p>
<p>For example, in Oaxaca, we visit <em>palenques</em> (mezcal farms) run by local friends that no other groups visit. In Mexico City, a longtime foodie resident takes us around on a culinary excursion.</p>
<p>In Romania, we get special permission to visit a Roma village.</p>
<p>In Morocco, we go into the mountains and stay with a Berber family.</p>
<p>In Italy and France, we dine at hidden restaurants I’ve discovered over the years where the menu is whatever the chef found at the market that day.</p>
<p>In Costa Rica, we do a homestay where you get to practice Spanish and eat with a family we know.</p>
<p>These itineraries are made using our connections to give you a deeper sense of the place and an understanding of the local culture. We don’t shuffle you from site to site. These tours are about connection! For that reason, all our tours have a maximum of 15 people too as we believe small groups foster better friendships and engender better experiences.</p>

We’ll explore the food and cocktail scene in Mérida, visit lesser-known Mayan ruins, wander through tiny towns, and swim in <em>cenotes</em> (swimming holes) devoid of the influencers you see on Instagram. This route really highlights one of the most interesting and culturally rich areas of Mexico.</p>

<h3 id="eight">Paris &amp; the Loire Valley, France</h3>
<p>This tour will take you around Paris and then into the Loire Valley, my favorite wine region of France.

<p><center>***</center></p>
<p><a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/tours" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our tours show you a more “nomadic” way of seeing places</a>. We stick to local transportation, non-touristy bars and restaurants I&#8217;ve found over the years, and focus more on people and experiences rather than sights. Anyone can take you to the David but we want to take you there with an art historian and then follow it up with a restaurant run by friends I know and places I love.</p>
<p>We want you to walk away with a sense of place — not just photos of you in front of buildings.</p>
<p>Additionally, most of the tours will have me or a team member on them. These tours are about community, after all, so we want to make sure we get to meet you all and spend some time traveling together (we don&#8217;t want to miss out on these awesome itineraries either).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve put over fifteen years of experience into creating these itineraries. They&#8217;re everything I wish I had when I started traveling. Whether you&#8217;re a newbie or a travel veteran, <a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/tours" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I hope you&#8217;ll join us</a>!</p>
<p>So far, we’ve sold out every tour we’ve done so be sure to join before we sell out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
<p>While each tour has its own FAQ, here are some general questions:</p>
<p><strong>What are your COVID policies?</strong><br />
This tour is currently open to all travelers. We will closely monitor any new policies and comply with any new restrictions or requirements needed. If the rules change, we&#8217;ll let you know. Visit each tour page for specifics.</p>
<p><strong>What about COVID testing? </strong><br />
Should COVID testing be required as a condition of entry or exit, we will help you find testing locations, though you are responsible for the cost of the COVID test and for booking your own tests.</p>
<p><strong>What is the age range of people on this tour?</strong><br />
Our tours see people from 22 to 75. They really run the gambit. In the past, the average age on tours is about 40. As we&#8217;ve found age is only a number, the variety in ages has never been detrimental to the group dynamics!</p>
<p><strong>Is there a lot of walking?</strong><br />
All our tours have lots of walking tours involved that last between 2-3 hours each. Some tours have more difficult hiking. Check each tour page for more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your guides.</strong><br />
Our expert tour leaders are fully licensed guides. They&#8217;ll be responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of the trip, handling all of the local logistics, and dealing with any unforeseen situations that may arise. Our tour leaders are always on hand, every day of the trip, to provide additional information, create spontaneous activities, join the group for non-included activities and meals, and ensure that the trip is as memorable, fun, and informative as possible. During the course of the trip, we&#8217;ll also use other guides for some of our day tours.</p>
<p><strong>Will I have any time to myself?</strong><br />
Of course! We hate tours that book every minute of your day. While we will be busy, there will also be plenty of time for you to explore on your own. Travel is about adventure and discovery, so we emphasize that on our tours. We want you to see stuff that interests you specifically.</p>
<p><strong>What am I going to do during the listed &#8220;free time&#8221;?</strong><br />
Our guides will be on hand to give you suggestions, help you decide what to do, and be around. If you want to go off on your own, we get that. We want you to explore and break out of your comfort zone! Our guides are here to help and, after you join the tour, you’ll be sent a list of potential activities you can do on your own.</p>
<p><strong>How many spots can I purchase at once?</strong><br />
Reservations on the tour are limited to a maximum of two per person to ensure that everyone who wants to gets a chance to go.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of rooms are we staying in?</strong><br />
We will be staying in 2 star or better hotels.</p>
<p><strong>Is airfare provided?</strong><br />
No, you’ll be responsible for your own airfare to and from the tour.</p>
<p><strong>Will I need travel insurance?</strong><br />
Yes, all guests will be required to have travel insurance for the duration of the trip. We’ll be asking for proof before departure. If you don’t have it, you won’t be able to continue on the tour.</p>
<p><strong>Is there an age requirement?</strong><br />
You must be at least 18 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Will I need to fill out any release forms? </strong><br />
Yes, you’ll be required to fill out and sign a liability waiver releasing us from any and all liability related to the tour.</p>
<p><strong>What about visas?</strong><br />
If you require a visa to enter any of these destinations, you’ll need to get that in advance at your own expense. We do not offer <em>any</em> help in this area.</p>
<p><strong>What if I change my mind? What is your refund policy?</strong><br />
We understand plans change. Deposits are refundable up to 30 days after purchase. They can also be transferred once in a calendar year to another tour. (You have to do so within 90 days.) Balance payments are due 31 days after purchase. Cancelations made between 90 – 60 days before the tour start date: 50% refund of the balance amount (the deposit is not included in the refund). Cancelations made between 59 – 0 days before the tour start date: 0% refund of the balance amount.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a waiting list?</strong><br />
People sometimes rush to secure a spot but don’t always get the time off work and might need to cancel. If you&#8217;d like to be added to a waiting list, please email us at info@thenomadicnetwork.com.</p>
<p><strong>I still have questions. Can I contact you?</strong><br />
Of course! Our email is info@thenomadicnetwork.com</p>

<strong>Posted</strong>: 9/23/22 | September 23rd, 2022</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/austin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Austin</a> may not be as weird as it once was but it’s still a fabulous city that I am proud to call home. The city has changed a lot since I first moved here over seven years ago, especially post-COVID, but it&#8217;s still a wonderful place with a lot of outdoor activities, has a constantly improving food and bar scene, welcoming people doing innovative things, and just a lot to keep you busy.</p>
<p>Austin isn&#8217;t a huge city. Most people come to visit for a few days and, honestly, you only need that amount of time to get a sense of the place. As a visitor, there are only a few areas I would recommend staying in during your time here. </p>
<p>To help you figure out where to stay in Austin, here is my breakdown of the best neighborhoods in the city as well as suggested accommodations for each.</p>
<p>But, before I get to that, here are answers to frequent questions I get asked about Austin:</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for food lovers?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/?paged=2#one">East Austin</a> has some of the best restaurants in town and, if you want to be close to food, you can&#8217;t go wrong here. The other option would be <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/?paged=2#four">South Congress Avenue</a> as that area has some of the city&#8217;s best restaurants too. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for families?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/?paged=2#two">Downtown Austin</a> is packed with enough attractions — including shops, restaurants, and landmarks — to keep you busy with your kids. It&#8217;s central to everything too. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for partying?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/?paged=2#two">Rainey Street</a>, located in Downtown Austin, is packed with nightlife fun and is very popular with weekend visitors. However, if you want to go where the locals go, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/?paged=2#one">East Austin</a> has some of the best bars in Austin and is packed with people during the weekend. West 6th is fun is you&#8217;re in your mid-twenties.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for outdoor enthusiasts?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/?paged=2#three">Zilker</a> is not just a near-perfect park of the same name. It’s also a neighborhood with some interesting attractions, including sculpture gardens. Zilker is all about the green spaces so if you like the outdoors, this is the neighborhood for you. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for shopping?</strong><br />
A long strip of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/?paged=2#four">South Congress Avenue</a> is lined with fun shops, many of which focus on kitschy retro stuff. Even if you’re not in the mood to spend money, browsing here is great entertainment. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood overall?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/?paged=2#one">East Austin</a> is the best area in the city. You get some of the best restaurants, bars, and vibes. It&#8217;s my favorite neighborhood in the city. The second would be South Congress. You can&#8217;t go wrong with either. </p>
<p>Here is a more specific breakdown of each neighborhood with suggested accommodations for each so you’ll know exactly where to stay in Austin during your next trip.</p>

<p><img alt="An aerial view overlooking East Austin in Austin, Texas" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/wheretostayaustin1.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
East Austin used to be &#8220;the bad neighborhood.&#8221; When I first came here, there wasn&#8217;t much to do in the area. But, in the last decade, this neighborhood has seen a massive influx of new residents, buildings, and restaurants as the city expanded east. Today, East Austin is one of the best dining areas in town (be sure to eat at Fukomoto, Via 313, and Corner Cafe). East Sixth has some of the best bars in the city (such as Whislers, Lazarus, Lolo Wine, and Lucky Duck). A lot of people live here so the area is always alive with activity. </p>

It’s also just a few minutes&#8217; walk to the famed Franklin Barbecue, one of the best places for BBQ on the planet. The property is comfortable and offers a free breakfast.

Downtown Austin isn’t the liveliest neighborhood in the city. It&#8217;s now a lot of hotels and office buildings. That said, it&#8217;s very centrally located, has the most variety of hotels, a lot of restaurants, and is close to most of the city&#8217;s attractions, such as the Capitol building, the Paramount Theater, the University of Texas, the LBJ Library, and “Dirty Sixth,” a swath of raucous Sixth Street that is famed for its dive bars. </p>

<h3 id="three">Where to Stay in Austin for Outdoor Fun: Zilker</a></h3>
<p><img alt="The lush and sprawling Zilker Park in Austin, Texas as seen from above" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/wheretostayaustin3.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
In 1918, Andrew Jackson Zilker donated 35 acres of land to the city, and a neighborhood and a park were born. While the district is dominated by the park of the same name, this south-central Austin swath of land has some interesting things to see and experience, including the Umlauf Sculpture Garden and the Barton Springs Pool. You can also walk the Greenbelt here and you&#8217;ll be near the lake too. It&#8217;s also home to the massive Austin City Limits music festival, which takes place in October. </p>
<p><strong>Best Places to Stay in Zilker</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BUDGET</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/hotel-south-first-street-austin.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Extended Stay America</a> — Located on the edge of Zilker, this chain-hotel is the most budget-friendly in the area. Most rooms have kitchenettes and dining space, so if you’re really looking to save money, this is a good choice as you can cook for yourself.
<li><strong>MIDRANGE</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/embassy-suites-austin-downtown-town-lake.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Embassy Suites by Hilton</a> — Anchored on the border where Zilker and the (Texan) Colorado River meet, Embassy Suites offers rooms with city views, free breakfast, an indoor pool, a fitness center, and a nightly reception with complimentary drinks.
<li><strong>LUXURY</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-carpenter.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Carpenter Hotel</a> — One of the few hotels in the middle of the Zilker neighborhood, Carpenter is a tranquil, open-air boutique property. The rooms are simple, with a lot of light-wood touches, and are very comfortable. All rooms have blackout shutters, and some have terraces. There&#8217;s a really nice pool on the property too.

<h3 id="four">Where to Stay in Austin for Shopping: South Congress</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Shops along the road in South Congress, Austin, Texas" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/wheretostayaustin4.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
SoCo, short for South Congress Avenue, is a strip that is crammed with hip shops selling vintage and retro clothes, furniture, lots of top restaurants, food trucks, and nightlife. This burgeoning area is located close to Lamar (another street filled with food and bars), the lake, and Zilker park too. It&#8217;s a lot busier than East Austin and, while it doesn&#8217;t have as much nightlife as other parts of the city, it&#8217;s one of the best neighborhoods for eating and shopping. If I&#8217;m not out in East Austin, I&#8217;m usually here.</p>
<p><strong>Best Place to Stay in South Congress</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BUDGET</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/red-roof-inn-university.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Red Roof Inn Austin South</a> — Budget options in South Congress are few and far between, so if you’re looking to save money in the area, this is your best bet. Located more toward East Congress, the hotel has free Wi-Fi, a swimming pool, and complimentary coffee in the lobby.
<li><strong>MIDRANGE</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/austin-motel.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Austin Motel</a> — Originally from the 1930s, the landmark Austin Motel has been renovated into a fun, retro property. There’s a pool, free parking, and it’s just a stone’s throw away from the Capitol.
<li><strong>LUXURY</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/south-congress.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">South Congress Hotel</a> — This hip property is a world in and of itself, with three restaurants, two bars, a bakery, a coffeehouse, two boutiques, and even a motorcycle shop all on-premises. The lobby is filled with locals who plant themselves here to socialize (and stare at their laptops). Rooms offer custom bathrobes, a minibar stocked with local products, and large walk-in showers with a rain shower head.
</ul>

<p>After living here for 7 years, I can safely say that <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/austin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Austin</a> is one of the best cities in the country. Nothing is more than 20 minutes away from anywhere else making it an easy city to navigate as you explore. It&#8217;s a perfect destination for a 3-4 day trip. And, since it&#8217;s not a huge city, you won&#8217;t have a problem getting around no matter where you stay. </p>

<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 9/29/22 | September 29th, 2022</p>
<p>Finding the best travel deals is a matter of timing.</p>
<p>A lot of people think travel is just expensive, but in reality, there are incredible deals happening all the time. They usually don’t last too long, and you have to act quickly. That can sometimes be a problem when a deal requires jumping on a plane tomorrow (how many people can do that?), but in fact, most deals are for months in the future, giving you ample time to plan your schedule.</p>
<p>Often I will book a flight and <em>then</em> figure out my plans. </p>
<p>Since you can usually cancel a flight within 24 hours without incurring a fee, I lock in the deal and then figure out if I can make it work. Sometimes I can (like the $1,200 USD business-class flight from <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/los-angeles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LA</a> to <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/sweden-travel-tips/stockholm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stockholm</a> round-trip); sometimes I can’t (like the $400 USD <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/new-zealand-travel-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Zealand</a> flights I had to cancel).</p>
<p>I am always looking out for deals.</p>
<p>Today, I want to tell you where I go for travel deals, tips, and expert advice. After all, these resources focus solely on this one aspect of travel, so why not use them? I can’t know everything, so I rely on specialists. If travel were a hospital, I would be your general practitioner. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick look at the top companies I use and suggest:</p>

When it comes to finding flight deals, I use these four websites for last-minute deals. There are always finding new (and tempting) last minute flights — often for a fraction of what you would pay otherwise. If you&#8217;re looking for something last minute and are flexible on where and when you go, use these websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theflightdeal.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Flight Deal</a> – This is a great resource for finding cheap flights from the USA. If you&#8217;re based in America, start your research here!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.secretflying.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Secret Flying</a> – If you&#8217;re based in Europe, this is the cheap flight website you&#8217;re going to want to start with as they can find amazing budget flights from Europe to destinations all around the globe.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.holidaypirates.com/flights" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Holiday Pirates</a> – No matter where you&#8217;re based this is a great cheap flight website so be sure to always check here for more deals.</li>

</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re simply looking to book a flight, check out the search engines below. It&#8217;s important to remember that there is no <em>one</em> best online booking website. All the search engine websites have blind spots so it&#8217;s important to search a few different places before you book your flight. Generally, the BEST booking sites are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/214481/1027991/13416?subId1=%26currency%3DUSD&#038;associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.com%2F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> &#8211; Skyscanner is a very intuitive platform that lets you search for an open-ended trip. If you&#8217;re not 100% sure where you want to go (or when) then start your search with Skyscanner.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Flights</a> &#8211; A good all-around flight search website to include in your cheap flight arsenal.</li>
<li><a href="https://rtwsecure.com/?a=39&amp;c=6&amp;p=r&amp;s1=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AirTreks</a> &#8211; If you&#8217;re looking to plan a multi-city trip, AirTreks offers great deals for round-the-world adventures with multiple stops.</li>
</ul>
<p>I always start my searches with <a href="https://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/214481/1027991/13416?subId1=%26currency%3DUSD&#038;associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.com%2F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a>. They search booking websites and airlines all around the world to ensure that no deal goes unlooked. They cast the widest net and constantly are vetting the sites they search. Start with them! </p>

<h3 id="second">Where to Find the Best Airline News</a></h3>
<p><img alt="amazing view from a plane" class="alignnone" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/howifindtraveldeals003.jpg" width="675" /><br />
When it comes to finding the latest in airline and frequent flier news, I turn to these sites, which give me the latest on the changes in the industry and loyalty programs, and any travel hacking news that might be important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">View from the Wing</a> &#8211; This is where I go for airline and frequent flier news.</li>
<li><a href="https://thepointsguy.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Points Guy</a> &#8211; A great resource for credit card and travel hacking news and information.</li>
<li><a href="https://onemileatatime.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One Mile at a Time</a> &#8211; This is a great website for credit card, in-flight experences, and frequent flier news.</li>
<li><a href="https://skift.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skift</a> &#8211; The best place for all airline and travel industry news.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Australia and New Zealand travel hacking, visit <a href="https://www.pointhacks.com.au" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Points Hack</a>.</p>
<p>For Canada, I use <a href="https://canadiankilometers.boardingarea.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian Kilometers</a> and <a href="https://princeoftravel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prince of Travel</a>.</p>
<p>For the UK, <a href="http://www.headforpoints.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Head for Points</a>.</p>
<p>As a very, very, very avid <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/product/guide-to-travel-hacking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">travel hacker</a> (and while I have my own special tricks and tips), when you’re overseas a lot, it&#8217;s hard to stay up to date on your own so I use these three sites to keep me in the loop.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="third">Where to Find the Best Cruise Deals</a></h3>
<p><img alt="view of a cruise ship deck" class="alignnone" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/howifindtraveldeals005.jpg" width="675" /><br />
In my mind, there is only one cruise deal website worth following: <a href="https://cruisesheet.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CruiseSheet</a>. This site consistently has some of the lowest rates out there, and their interface is beautiful. </p>
<p>If I don’t find anything on CruiseSheet or want to double-check a price, I go to the second-best website, <a href="https://www.vacationstogo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vacationstogo.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="fourth">Where to Find the Best Transportation Deals</a></h3>
<p><img alt="An old airstream RV crusing down the open road in the USA" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/transportationdeal1.jpg" width="675" /><br />
If you&#8217;re looking for budget transportation, these are the websites you&#8217;ll want to check. Cheap buses, trains, and rideshare apps can help keep your transportation costs low, giving you more time on the road. Here are my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flixbus.pxf.io/c/1314291/477459/8366?u=https%3A%2F%2Fglobal.flixbus.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FlixBus</a> &#8211; A budget-friendly bus company routes all across Europe and parts of the USA.</li>

<h3 id="fifth">Where to Find the Best Accommodation Deals</a></h3>
<p><img alt="bed, desk, and couch in a hotel room" class="alignnone" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/howifindtraveldeals006.jpg" width="675" /><br />
From hotels to hostels to camping, there are tons of great websites out there to help you find deals and save money. Here are my suggestions to help you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=362916" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> &#8211; This is the best website for finding hotels no matter where you are in the world. I usually start my search for hotel rooms here.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3032045/type/dlg/https://www.agoda.com/?cid=1844104" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Agoda.com</a> &#8211; While you can use Agoda for finding hotels worldwide, I specifically use Agoda when looking for hotels in Asia.

<strong>Posted</strong>: 10/24/2022 | October 24th, 2022</p>
<p>From Mayan ruins to lush jungles to pristine beaches, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/mexico-travel-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico</a> is an amazing — but often overlooked — destination.</p>
<p>Sure, lots of people visit the resort hot spots along the coast, but there is much more to the country than all-inclusive resorts.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I was late to exploring Mexico. It wasn’t until recently that I finally traveled beyond the infamous tourist meccas of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/mexico-travel-tips/cancun/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cancún</a> and <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/tulum-sucks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tulum</a>. But when I did, I fell in love. Mexico City is a world-class destination bursting with arts and culture, and the booming mezcal industry in Oaxaca (along with its top-notch culinary scene) has made it one of my favorite places in the world. </p>
<p>Mexico is an amazing country to backpack around, drive through, or just vacation in. There’s an endless variety of things to see and do, and the locals are some of the friendliest people on the planet. </p>
<p>Yet the country is constantly tagged in the media as being unsafe. Drugs, corruption, cartels — the list goes on.</p>
<p>While it’s true Mexico has its struggles (it ranks in the top 20 when it comes to homicides per capita), the majority of violent crime is gang-related. That means as a regular traveler, you won’t need to spend your days looking over your shoulder.</p>
<p>However, there are some things to keep in mind when you visit Mexico. Here’s everything you need to know to stay safe and have fun in Mexico.</p>

</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="one">Is Mexico safe for solo travelers?</a></h3>
<p>Mexico is safe for solo travelers, though it never hurts to travel in groups if you’re going out at night. Sharing taxis is also a good choice, as there is always safety in numbers. But overall, solo travelers don’t need to be perpetually on guard here. Just take the standard precautions (keep your valuables secure, always be aware of your surroundings, etc.) and you will avoid most of the common pitfalls in Mexico.</p>
<p>Additionally, learning some Spanish will go a long way in helping you stay safe, as you’ll be better able to fit in and understand what is being said around you.</p>
<h3 id="two">Is Mexico safe for solo female travelers?</a></h3>
<p>Mexico is safe for solo female travelers as long as they take the same precautions they would elsewhere. This includes things like keeping an eye on your drink at the bar and avoiding walking around alone at night (especially after drinking).</p>
<p>Moreover, consider booking centrally located accommodation so you’ll be staying in a well-lit area. Try to avoid wearing flashy jewelry or flaunting your electronic devices as well, since most petty crimes are crimes of opportunity.</p>
<p>Lastly, ignore catcallers, should that be an issue. They can become aggressive, so it’s best to just ignore them if you encounter them.</p>
<h3 id="three">Are taxis safe in Mexico?</a></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, taxis in the major tourist areas — from Mexico City to Oaxaca to Cancún — are safe and reliable. Just make sure you’re getting in a legitimate, authorized taxi. When in doubt, have your accommodation call and order a taxi for you.</p>
<p>Just be aware that not every city has taxis that use meters, so make sure you ask about the price in advance if there is no meter.</p>
<p>As a general rule, avoid flagging down random taxis, as they are not always legit. When in doubt, opt for Uber if it’s available. Or Didi, which is the local version of Uber. Both are super safe to use.</p>
<h3 id="four">Is renting a car safe in Mexico?</a></h3>
<p>Overall, it’s safe to rent a car in Mexico. Always follow the speed limit and rules of the road, however, as it’s not uncommon for police to stop vehicles for minor infractions in hopes of a bribe.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s best to avoid driving at night, as that is when carjackings are most likely to take place.</p>
<p>While every region is different, the best place to rent a car is on the Yucatán Peninsula. The roads are generally well maintained, and the region is relatively safe for driving and exploring off the beaten path.</p>
<p>For the best rental car prices, use <a href="https://www.discovercars.com/?a_aid=nomadicmatt" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discover Cars</a>.</p>
<h3 id="five">Is the tap water safe in Mexico?</a></h3>
<p>In most places, the tap water in Mexico is not safe to drink. While Mexico’s purification and treatment systems have improved, it’s still best to avoid drinking tap water and drinks with ice (unless the ice is made from filtered water). You can get away with in in Puerto Vallarta, but in most other regions you&#8217;ll want to avoid it.</p>
<p>While it’s fine to shower, you’ll likely want to avoid brushing your teeth with tap water, just to be safe. </p>
<p>Since single-use plastic is bad for the environment, bring a water filter. <a href="https://lifestraw.xyibsh.net/mgXd1D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LifeStraw</a> makes reusable bottles with a built-in filter so you can ensure that your water is always clean and safe.</p>
<h3 id="six">Can I walk around at night in Mexico?</a></h3>
<p>Most of the popular destinations in Mexico have tourist zones in which the majority of attractions and restaurants are located. These are generally safe to explore at night, though you’ll want to make sure your valuables are secure and that, whenever possible, you travel in a group. Even in non-tourist zones, you&#8217;ll be ine too. Mexico has a night culture so lots of people are out and about in the evening meaning there&#8217;s a lot of eyes on the streets. More people = less chance for crime. </p>
<p>But always double-check with your accommodation on arrival to see if there are any areas you shouldn’t go to at night (or during the day).</p>
<h3 id="seven">Are there areas in Mexico should I avoid?</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there are. Ciudad Juárez, Zacatecas, Sinaloa, and Colima are generally considered the main places to avoid in Mexico. Does that mean they are open war zones and you’ll be mugged or killed on arrival? Of course not. But in these destinations, safety is a definite concern — even for locals. This is where you will find a lot of the cartel activity and I wouldn&#8217;t recommend visiting these places.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="eight">9 Safety Tips for Mexico</a></h3>
<p><img alt="A colorful, empty cobblestone street in Mexico" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/mexicosafe1.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
<strong>1. Get a Mexican SIM card</strong> – Having a working phone is essential in case of an emergency. If you’re from the US, you may have cell phone service while in Mexico at no additional cost. If not, consider picking up a Mexican SIM card when you arrive. You’ll get better coverage and be able to access maps whenever you need them. They’re cheap too, costing around $10 USD.</p>
<p><strong>2. Only drive during the day</strong> – If you rent a car, stick to driving during the day. Carjackings are common but usually happen at night. While there are lots of government checkpoints to help keep things safe, it’s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p><strong>3. Learn some Spanish</strong> – The more Spanish you know, the easier you’ll be able to fit in. Moreover, should something happen, you’ll be able to call for help more easily. Learn a few practical words and phrases before your trip.</p>
<p><strong>4. Don’t dress flashy</strong> – Flaunting jewelry, expensive phones, or laptops is a sure-fire way to be targeted by criminals. Do your best to fit in by not wearing jewelry and keeping your phone out of reach unless you absolutely need it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don’t do drugs</strong> – Mexico has a cartel problem, and that is fueled by recreational drug users. Buying drugs directly supports the cartels and puts Mexican citizens at risk. Do not do drugs here.</p>
<p><strong>6. Don’t drink the water</strong> – While most restaurants and cafés use filtered water for their drinks, ice is another matter. Always ask if you’re unsure, or stick to drinks without ice. Avoid using tap water for brushing your teeth too, although it’s fine for showering.</p>
<p><strong>7. Trust your gut</strong> – If a food stall or restaurant looks unsanitary, it probably is. On the other hand, if you’re unsure of where to eat, pick the taco stand with the longest queue. If there’s a huge line, it’s probably because the food is great. Locals know the best places to eat, so trust their choices!</p>
<p><strong>8. Be mindful of your money</strong> – Don’t carry every peso you have in your wallet or pocket. Spread it around (some in your wallet, some in the hotel safe, some in your backpack), so that if someone steals your wallet or robs you, you’ll still have money elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>9. Be careful when using ATMs</strong> – Only use ATMs inside a bank. Robberies are much more common at outdoor ATMs, and skimmers can be placed on outdoor ATMs (to steal your PIN). To stay safe, only use indoor ATMs.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="nine">So, Should You Visit Mexico?</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely! I visit multiple times each year and always love my time there. It’s affordable, the food is amazing, and there is a ton to see and do. <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/mexico-love/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">While I was late to the game</a> on Mexico, I’m definitely a convert now and can’t recommend it enough. Whether you’re a budget or luxury traveler, travel newbie or veteran, you’ll find plenty to enjoy here.</p>
<p>Before you go, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-travel-insurance-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">buy travel insurance</a>. We never think that something is going to go wrong on trips. But it does sometimes — which I’ve learned from experience. I’ve popped an eardrum, had my gear break, and lost my luggage.</p>
<p>While it’s not fun to think about, bad things can happen while you’re traveling. That’s why I never leave home without travel insurance. You shouldn’t either — especially if you’re heading to Mexico. For just a couple of bucks a day, you’ll get a safety net that ensures that you won’t go bankrupt should something bad and unexpected happen. Don’t cheap out on your health and safety. It’s not worth the risk. </p>

<p><center>***</center></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/mexico-travel-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico</a> is a vibrant and lively destination, perfect for foodies, road-trippers, resort-goers, party animals, and everyone in between. It’s a fun place to let loose and soak up the sun (<a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/tours/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">we run tours there for a reason</a>, after all!). </p>
<p>Just make sure you follow the tips above so that you can enjoy your trip safely and avoid some of the more common pitfalls. While the country is not nearly as dangerous as the media makes it seems, it’s always better to be safe than sorry. By following the advice above, you’ll be able to stay safe while making the most of your visit.</p>

            <title>Remember Your Travels With This Travel Journal</title>
            <link>https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-journal/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Posted: 10/25/22 &amp;#124; October 25th, 2022 When I first started traveling around
                the world, I kept a journal. I recorded everything that happened to me, who I met, how I felt, and how

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="A picture of My Travel Journal" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/traveljournal2.jpg" width="675" /><br />
<strong>Posted</strong>: 10/25/22 | October 25th, 2022</p>
<p>When I first started traveling around the world, I kept a journal. I recorded everything that happened to me, who I met, how I felt, and how much I spent. </p>
<p>When I sat down a few years ago to <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/ten-years-a-nomad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">write my memoir</a>, that journal was indispensable. There, among its pages, were 18 months of memories, feelings, and activities long forgotten. It was a trip down memory lane that made me relive my original journey in a way I never thought possible. Reading that journal made me realize how much I had forgotten. </p>
<p>I hear from people all the time that they wish they kept some kind of record of their trip. After all, memories fade and warp with time. Having a written record allows you to remember the reality of the moment. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s precisely the reason we created My Travel Journal.</p>
<p>This new journal has been in the works since March and, after a few months of tweaking the design and learning about paper quality and the entire printing process, we sent our “manuscript” to the printer in June.</p>
<p>“Ok great,” they said, “You’ll get in in October.” </p>
<p>“Can I get a sample copy before it goes to print?” I asked.</p>
<p>They said no. </p>
<p>Due to all the issues printers are having with supplies as well as the fact most are now moving production out of China and back to the States, there just wasn&#8217;t the capacity to do “one-offs.” All I could get was a mock-up using regular paper instead of the material we are using for the final copy. </p>
<p>As two really, really good friends of mine use this company and said they had never had a quality problem, I said, “OK, go to print. I’m off to <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/europe-travel-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Europe</a>, and we really want to get this product out in time for the holidays!”</p>
<p>Last week, I finally got the finished journal in my hands.</p>
<p>The paper quality is beautiful, the cover is perfect, and the printing is perfect. It’s all perfect — except for one thing. </p>
<p>Our idea was to create a Moleskine-like journal with travel prompts. It was supposed to have one page for every day of the year. That’s 365 pages plus some for quotes.</p>
<p>That’s what I got. At 180+ sheets (365 days, front and back), I thought it would be thinner than Moleskines, which are 240 pages. </p>
<p>Except, while Moleskines do have 240 pages, they are just 120 <em>sheets</em> thick. Why I did the math right for my journal but did not do likewise for the Moleskine is beyond me! So our journal is about 200 sheets thick. Which means it looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The Remember Your Travels journal compared to a Moleskine journal, side by side" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/journalupdate1.jpeg" width="675" /></p>
<p>“Wow! This is&#8230;big,” I said to myself. I mean, we got what we wanted. It is a journal with prompts for every day of the year. It still looks great and is the high quality we wanted. It’s just thicker than expected. </p>
<p>So, we’re thinking of this as our special “jumbo” edition — perfect for long-term travelers, people studying or living abroad, or those who just want a full year of journaling in one place!</p>
<p>It has everything you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the prompts for travel, or in your day-to-day life at home. </li>
<li>You can get inspired by the quotes. </li>
<li>You can use it as a reminder that sometimes things don’t work out as planned, but all you can do is make the best of the situation. </li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see below, we&#8217;ve designed the journal to be as straightforward and streamlined as possible so that you can remember all those incredible moments. It will help you get into the habit of journaling every day. Here&#8217;s what the interior of the journals looks like:</p>

<img alt="The interior of the Remember My Travels journal" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/journalupdate4.jpeg" width="675" /></p>
<p>Our thinner-sized (aka “normal”) journal will be out in the spring. But, until then, we have this beautiful product that will still make a great journal or gift for travelers and expats alike. </p>
<p>We’re selling this our “jumbo” journal at cost ($15 USD plus shipping) until November 14th to help us reduce the inventory in our warehouse (7,000 copies take up a lot of room!).</p>
<p><a href="https://rememberyourtravels.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You can get it via our website here</a>. Use the code JUMBO.</p>
<p>One of the best souvenirs I have from my earliest travels is my travel journal. Capturing my thoughts and feelings as I traveled has allowed me to relive those trips over and over again in the years since. I can&#8217;t recommend journaling while you travel enough. </p>
<p>So, be sure to jump on this limited-edition journal! It’s especially ideal for those living abroad or going on extended travels, or those who like to illustrate their journals with postcards, train tickets, etc. If you have any questions, email me at matt@nomadicmatt.com.</p>

<strong>Posted</strong>: 10/26/22 | October 26th, 2022</p>
<p>With its picturesque canals, iconic gondolas, and winding alleyways, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/italy-travel-tips/venice/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Venice</a> is an incredibly beautiful, magical, and evocative city popular with honeymooners, backpackers, and cruisers alike.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its romantic beauty also makes it one of the most visited destinations in the world — and also makes it expensive. Everyone wants to spend time exploring the Renaissance palaces and historic town squares while eating endless amounts of gelato, pizza, and pasta.</p>
<p>The Floating City’s popularity can make it a bit difficult to visit on a budget, but luckily there are a growing number of affordable hostels for the backpacker and budget traveler. While they won’t make Venice a dirt-cheap destination, they can help keep your budget intact as you explore this iconic Italian destination.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll share the best hostels in Venice to help make your trip easier. But before we dive in there are a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel. After over a decade of backpacking around the world, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-pick-a-good-hostel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I’ve learned what makes a good hostel great</a>. </p>
<p>The top four factors are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Location</strong> – Venice is a bit spread out between the mainland and various islands, meaning that it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is near the sites you want to see and/or the nightlife you want to experience. All the hostels listed here are centrally located.</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong> – In Venice, you get what you pay for, so if you go with a really cheap hostel, you’re probably going to get one that is cramped and doesn’t offer great service.</li>
<li><strong>Amenities</strong> – Most hostels offer free Wi-Fi, and some even include free breakfast, but if you want more than that, do your research to find one that best meets your needs.</li>
<li><strong>Staff</strong> – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don’t stay at one of the places listed below, look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly. They can make or break a hostel!</li>
</ol>
<p>To help you plan your trip, below is my list of the best hostels in Venice. They all offer a welcome respite and a cozy and friendly place to hang out with fellow travelers — all while keeping your budget intact. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to read the whole list, the following are the best in each category:</p>

<p><strong>Price (per night)</strong></p>

<li>$$ = 25-35 EUR</li>
<li>$$$ = Over 35 EUR </li>

<h3>1. Generator Venice</h3>
<p><img alt="Common area with a bar, bar tables, and red comfy chairs by a fireplace at Generator hostel in Venice, Italy." height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/generatorvenicehostel.jpg" width="675" /><br />
European chain Generator’s Venice hostel is located on Giudecca Island, just one stop on the vaporetto taxi from the famous Piazza San Marco. Originally a grain warehouse, the building has been renovated in a rustic-chic style, with tiled floors, exposed brick, and even a chandelier and stone fireplace in the common room. They have dorms with 3-16 beds (and female-only dorms) as well as private rooms too. In the dorms, each bed has its own reading light, socket, and locker (though you have to pay for the locker). </p>
<p>The hostel café’s outdoor terrace along the canal is one of the best features of this place, with views across the canal to Venice’s Centro Storico (historic center). It’s a great place to start the morning or wind down after a long day exploring, and it hosts a happy hour every day from 6:30-8:30pm. </p>
<p>The only downside is that there’s no kitchen or fridge if you want to make your own meals or store food. </p>
<p>And, while there are a variety of common spaces, Generator Venice has more of a hotel vibe than a hostel feel (it’s also not a super social hostel as there are no organized activities). </p>

&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Anda Venice</h3>
<p><img alt="White pod-style bunk beds in a brightly lit room at Anda hostel in Venice, Italy." height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/andavenicehostel.jpg" width="675" /><br />
This award-winning hostel is super social — and the best party hostel in Venice, with nightly events like karaoke and beer pong, and DJ sets on the weekends. Though it’s located on the mainland, it’s easy to get into the historic center, as it’s just a couple minutes’ walk from the central train station. There are both private rooms and dorms (including female-only dorms). Dorm beds have a privacy curtain, socket, locker, and reading light. The mattresses are pretty comfy, though the shower pressure leaves a little bit to be desired. </p>
<p>There’s a 24-hour reception, a bar/club, and lots of common areas too, including a private courtyard with an urban garden and a co-working area, which has workstations with Macs in case you don’t have a computer with you. This is a nice and uncommon perk if you’re working remotely and want to use a desktop, or if you’re not traveling with your laptop and want to use something other than your phone. There’s also a (small) guest kitchen and laundry on-site.</p>
<p>Visitors also get 10% off, a free welcome drink, and free city map if you&#8217;re a member of <a href="https://www.hostelpass.co/hostel-card/?ref=mattkepnes4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HostelPass</a>.</p>

<h3> 3. Ostello S. Fosca </h3>
<p><img alt="Enclosed backyard with trees, metal patio tables, and a church in the distance at Ostello S. Fosca hostel in Venice, Italy." height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/ostellohostel.jpg" width="675" /><br />
Arguably the most centrally located hostel in Venice, Ostello S. Fosca is within walking distance to all the city’s main sights, yet it&#8217;s also tucked away on a quiet canal so you can still get a good night’s rest. While there isn’t a big social vibe here, the staff are super kind and eager to help with anything that you need. </p>
<p>The location and affordable price point are the main reasons to stay here as the dorms are pretty basic with squeaky (but clean) metal beds. Also, there’s AC only in some of the rooms, so if you stay here in the hotter months, it can get pretty stuffy. </p>
<p>However, this hostel is pretty great if you’re looking for a quiet, centrally located stay. It&#8217;s in a lovely historic building with a huge, enclosed outdoor patio and yard to relax in on nice days. There’s also a fully equipped kitchen and female-only dorms, and you can leave your luggage here for free for the rest of the day after you check out. </p>
<p>One thing to note is that there’s a 15 EUR check-in fee if you arrive after 8pm, and you’re out of luck if you arrive after 10pm. If you know you’ll be arriving late, it might be better to choose another hostel.</p>

<h3>4. A&#038;O Venezia Mestre</h3>
<p><img alt="Expansive lobby with chandeliers and reception desk that says ‘everyone can travel’ at a&#038;o hostel in Venice, Italy." height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/aovenicehostel.jpg" width="675" /><br />
A&#038;O is another big European hostel chain. There are actually two connected a&#038;o hostels here, but the facilities are more or less the same no matter which one you stay in (though there is only one communal kitchen, so you might have to go next door to use it). They are located next to the main train station, making it easy to get into Venice’s historic center. </p>
<p>Given that the building is an entire city block, there are a lot of amenities here, including a 24-hour reception and a ton of common areas, including co-working space, a kid’s play area, and a kitchen with a daily all-you-can-eat breakfast for 8.90 EUR. If you’re road-tripping <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/italy-travel-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Italy</a>, there’s even parking available, and if you’re traveling with a pet, you can bring it (if you get a private room). There are female-only dorms as well. In short: no matter what you’re looking for, a&#038;o probably has it (except a party — this is a fairly quiet hostel). </p>
<p><strong> a&#038;o Venezia Mestre at a glance</strong>:</p>

<li>Many common areas, including a co-working space</li>
<li>Huge hostel with a hotel-like atmosphere </li>
<li>Guest kitchen and café with buffet breakfast (8.90 EUR)</li>

<h3>5. Combo Venezia</h3>
<p><img alt="Historic cloister filled with orange trees and people standing around chatting at Combo Venezia, a hostel in Venice, Italy." height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/comboveneziahostel.jpg" width="675" /></p>
<p>While it bills itself as a hostel, Combo Venezia is more like a boutique hotel than your traditional backpacker hostel. There are no dorm rooms here, but instead affordable private rooms and fully furnished apartments in a beautifully restored historic convent. It&#8217;s a good option if you&#8217;re looking for more privacy than a traditional hostel and are willing to pay a bit more. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bar-restaurant on-site with an outdoor terrace right along the canal, 24-hour reception, a huge cloistered courtyard, a communal guest kitchen (as well as kitchens in the apartment-style rooms), laundry facilities, and clean, comfy, modern rooms, all with en-suite bathrooms (with good water pressure!). Considering the central location in Centro Storico, range of amenities, and modern rooms, you get a lot for what you pay here.</p>
<p><strong>Combo Venezia at a glance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>$$$</li>
<li>Centrally located in Centro Storico</li>
<li>Boutique-hotel atmosphere in a huge, restored convent</li>

<p><em>Private rooms from 108 EUR.</em></p>

<strong>Posted</strong>: 10/27/22 | October 27th, 2022</p>
<p><em>This is a guest post from Angelina (Gigi) Chow, who blogs about international dog travel at <a href="https://wetnoseescapades.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wet Nose Escapades</a>. For the last five years, she has flown her ultra-bossy Yorkshire terrier Roger Wellington on over 50 flights across more than 20 countries. She’s here to tell you what mistakes to avoid when traveling with your small dog. </em></p>
<p>With dog ownership on the rise, many people are not only new to dog parenthood but also dog travel. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), more than 23 million American households (nearly one in five nationwide) adopted a pet during the pandemic. And approximately 37% of pet owners travel with their pets, compared to just 19% a decade ago. The US Department of Transportation estimates that over <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/pets-on-planes/lesson-2-pets-on-planes/care-and-handling-of-pets-during-air-travel#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20United%20States,happily%20reunited%20with%20their%20owners." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two million pets</a> travel by air each year. </p>
<p>With travel demand storming back post-pandemic, these statistics are projected to skyrocket year after year. In addition to the usual road trips, many dogs are now flying on planes for the first time. Although it seems glamorous to take your pooch to a Parisian café or meander around the Jardin de Luxembourg, the stakes of traveling with it are high, if not done correctly. Even if your dog lands safely at the destination, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the flight wasn’t a <a href="https://wetnoseescapades.com/how-stressful-is-flying-for-dogs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stressful or traumatic experience for it</a>. </p>
<p>Unless you have a service animal, in-cabin air travel is usually a small dog’s game. Those that are too big to fly in-cabin (often capped at 16-20 lbs., depending on the airline) must travel in the cargo hold as checked baggage or shipping cargo. Due to extreme hot or cold temperatures, poor ventilation, rough handling, and lack of monitoring, animal welfare organizations like the Humane Society and PETA generally advise against flying your dog in the cargo hold. So flying in-cabin is always the safer choice. </p>
<p>After over five years of globetrotting with my 7-lb. Yorkie Roger Wellington, I’ve learned that preparation is key for every in-cabin flight. Whether you’re planning a weekend getaway or overseas vacation, you must avoid these nine newbie mistakes when traveling with your small dog. </p>
<h3>1. Not investing enough time into carrier training </h3>
<p><img alt="A small dog traveling in a dog travel carrier" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/dogtravel1.png" width="675" /><br />
<a href="https://wetnoseescapades.com/dog-hates-carrier/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carrier training</a> is the most important step in flying with your small dog. The objective is to help your pet feel comfortable and safe inside the carrier before a flight. This step must not be overlooked, as it takes patience, time, and lots of treats. You should invest at least two to three months doing daily carrier training before your pet’s first long-haul international flight, and a month minimum before a domestic flight. Otherwise, the trip can be a nerve-racking experience for the animal. </p>
<p>Daily repetition is crucial for success. For three months before Roger W.’s first international flight to Paris, I spent at least 20 minutes every single day transforming the carrier into the most exciting place in the world. To entice him, I put his favorite toys and treats inside the carrier, so he would go in for a sniff. </p>
<p>I recommend starting slowly, that is, having your dog explore the carrier for a few minutes a day, and then gradually closing it up once it voluntarily goes inside for the third or fourth time. Increase the training time every day with the intent of creating a safe haven inside the carrier. Depending on the length of the flight, you’ll want to train your pet to feel comfortable there for at least 1-3 hours before travel day. The more at ease your dog feels inside the carrier, the better it will cope with the flight. </p>

<h3>2. Not researching the return flight requirements </h3>
<p>Most people who plan on traveling internationally with their dogs focus on conducting one-way research, e.g. how to get their pooch to Paris or Rome. They do minimal research for their return flight until it’s almost time to go home. </p>
<p>Unless you’re moving permanently, you must make sure you meet the requirements for your dog to return to the US, which may differ based on where you’ve traveled with it. Your state of arrival may also have <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/bring-pet-into-the-united-states/pet-travel-dogs-into-us" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">additional requirements</a>. </p>
<p>For instance, dogs imported into <a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/companion-animals" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York State</a> from outside the US must have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) issued 30 days or less before entry by a veterinarian. The certificate should have a one-year or three-year rabies vaccination record.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to understand that return to the US ultimately depends on where your dog has been. For example, there is a temporary suspension until January 2023 for dogs coming from “high-risk” countries with rabies (e.g., Brazil, Cuba, China, Russia, etc.). If you are trying to return to the US from a country so classified, then your pet must have a CDC Dog Import Permit or a current, valid, US-issued rabies vaccination certificate, plus proof of an ISO-compatible microchip. It also must be at least six months old, and healthy upon arrival (at one of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/dog-origin.html#airports-18" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">18 designated airports</a> with a CDC quarantine station). </p>
<p>For re-entry to the US from a country NOT considered high-risk for rabies (e.g., France, Belgium, Italy, UK, etc.), your dog can enter at any port with a six-month travel history statement and healthy appearance. It must also be at least six months old and microchipped, and have a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/apply-dog-import-permit.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CDC Import Dog Permit</a> or valid US-issued rabies vaccination certificate. </p>
<p>If you’re <a href="https://wetnoseescapades.com/traveling-to-europe-from-us-with-dog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traveling throughout Europe with your dog</a>, you should note that some countries are considered “high-risk” for rabies by the EU (for instance, Montenegro). This means your pet will need a titer test before returning to a “rabies-controlled” country in the EU. </p>
<p>To find out exactly what requirements you need to meet, you can get more information on <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/bring-pet-into-the-united-states/pet-travel-dogs-into-us" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">USDA APHIS</a>. </p>
<p>Besides rabies regulations, there are also specific requirements if you’re returning to the US from countries where screwworm is known to exist or not declared free of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
<h3>3. Making your dog’s first flight an international one</h3>
<p>Long-haul flights are difficult for everyone, and your little furry traveler is no exception. No matter how confident you feel about your small dog’s world-traveling capabilities, its very first flight experience should never be a long-haul international flight. For your pooch’s sake, it’s best to ease its way in by hopping on at least one domestic flight before traveling overseas. I flew Roger W. on four flights from San Francisco to Los Angeles (and back) and from California to NYC before committing to a 10+-hour flight from Los Angeles to Paris. </p>
<p>Unlike humans, dogs have no idea where they’re going and how long they must remain on the plane. So the more exposure to flight you can provide your small dog, the better it will fare on the big (long) travel day. </p>
<p>And, it’s not just the act of flying that your pet should be familiar with, but also the overall airport environment. For instance, it helps to acquaint your small dog with plane noise, airport sounds, crowds, TSA screening, and the boarding process. All in all, familiarity breeds comfort. </p>
<h3>4. Booking a flight with more than one layover </h3>
<p>While it’s tempting to save money by choosing an itinerary with multiple layovers, you should fly direct with your small dog whenever possible. Again, they don’t know where they’re going and how long it takes to get there. Even one seemingly quick layover can add more stress to your dog’s little body on a long travel day. If multiple layovers are impossible to avoid, you should give your pet some much-needed rest by spending a few days to a week at the layover destination before hopping on another flight. </p>
<p>Often, I’m asked if it’s better to take one long flight or shorter flights with a layover. My rule of thumb is that if the flight is longer than 11 or 12 hours, I suggest breaking down the travel day. The shorter the journey, the easier it’ll be for your dog. A few days of rest can help it reset and re-energize for the next travel day. Plus, you both get to explore a different place before reaching the final destination!</p>
<h3>5. Not exhausting your dog’s energy </h3>
<p><img alt="A solo female traveler traveling the world with her small dog who is drinking water from a fountain in Europe" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/dogtravel2.png" width="675" /><br />
Before any flight, it’s imperative to exercise your pet to exhaust its energy. As the old saying goes, a tired dog is a happy dog! Make it a routine to walk it before every flight to ensure an effortless, relaxing journey. The key here is not to force your dog into intense physical activity but to just add an extra 15-20 minutes of exercise and playtime to help it sleep through the flight. The longer it can sleep on the plane, the smoother the ride will be. </p>
<p>However, please keep your dog’s overall health and weather conditions in mind before extending the time: of course, it shouldn’t endure an extra 15 minutes out in the extreme heat or cold.</p>
<p>For long-haul flights, I always make sure Roger W. relieves himself before heading to the airport. His walks typically take 45 minutes, so I would extend it to 60 minutes to tire him out a bit more. Upon arrival at the airport, I also walk him around the exterior grounds and take him to the outdoor pet relief area, if any. You can find <a href="https://petfriendlytravel.com/pet-relief-areas-airports-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pet relief areas at US airports here</a>.</p>
<p>After checking in for our flight at the counter, I take him back outside for one last potty break. Even though many airports have pet relief areas inside the terminals now, Roger W. strongly prefers the outdoors over artificial lawn, which is found at most indoor pet relief rooms. If your dog has no problem relieving himself on the artificial lawn (which generally has a diverse collection of “pee-mail”), you probably won’t need to take it outside again. </p>
<h3>6. Not being strategic with water and food intake </h3>
<p>In the world of air travel, people tend to have an extremely low tolerance for “misbehaving” dogs, especially when it comes to accidents. No one wants to sit next to a dog (regardless of how tiny) who just wet the floor (the same goes for barking). Therefore, prevent accidents by strategizing feeding times and water and food portions, before and during the flight, in addition to potty breaks. Never fly your small dog on a full or empty stomach; the ideal feeding time should be roughly around two hours before heading to the airport, so as to allow time for digestion and relief. </p>
<p>Depending on the temperature in-cabin, I offer fresh water to Roger W. every 3-4 hours on long-haul flights (seven hours or longer) and every two hours on short-haul flights (under seven hours) in addition to assessing his needs. I also prefer giving him light meals or small portions throughout the flight to balance preventing accidents and ensuring that he has enough to eat. If the flight is under four hours, I would only give treats to reward good behavior and withhold actual meals until landing. The longer the flight, the more calculated you’ll have to be with water and food intake. </p>
<h3>7. Not being prepared for accidents </h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, “misbehaving” dogs are frowned upon, and the last thing you want to do is scramble to find supplies to clean up after your pet. No matter how <a href="https://wetnoseescapades.com/potty-train-your-dog-without-a-crate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potty-trained</a> your small dog is, accidents can still happen in a new environment, especially a stressful one. </p>
<p>Even with months invested in carrier training, accidents may still occur, since confined dogs are merely trying their best to “hold it” for as long as possible to avoid <a href="https://wetnoseescapades.com/reasons-not-crate-dog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soiling their beds</a>. Whether you’re walking your pooch inside the terminal or flying in-cabin 35,000 feet in the air, you should have poop bags, pee pads, dog wipes, and hand wipes handy, so you can quickly clean up after your dog without commotion. Pack these essential items inside your personal item or carry-on, where you can easily access them. </p>
<p>Remember to be empathetic if you catch your dog in action, because it has either held it in for a long time or feels anxious in the unfamiliar environment. Don’t make a scene or scream at it — just swiftly clean it up and move on (plus, dogs learn best through positive reinforcement anyway). </p>
<p>Also: Be realistic! After a 10-hour flight, do you expect your dog to “hold it” until it walks out of the airport or makes it to a pet relief area? Even if a four-hour flight may not sound so long, that can easily add up to seven hours if you account for pre-flight check-in, TSA screening, boarding, and deboarding. Roger W. has never had an accident on a plane in over five years of traveling, but I stay prepared for quick and easy cleanup if an accident occurs. </p>
<h3>8. Flaunting your dog </h3>
<p><img alt="A small dog looking out over the ocean" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/dogtravel4.png" width="675" /></p>
<p>While you’ll meet many dog-loving travelers, you’ll also find others who are indifferent, scared, or even disgusted by your mini four-legged traveler. Although it may be disheartening to accept, you should never assume everyone likes dogs or feels comfortable with them. Respect the people who may fear or dislike them, feel uneasy around them, or suffer from allergies. </p>
<p>Always keep a low profile unless you’ve scanned the room. Don’t flaunt your small dog; you don’t want a disgruntled passenger making a petty complaint about your pet’s behavior or presence. The less attention, the better. </p>
<p>Again, “misbehaving” dogs are rarely tolerated by passengers or airline staff. Unfortunately, even snot-shooting, screaming babies have better luck than quiet, well-behaved lap dogs. Most passengers don’t notice that I have a small dog on the plane until it comes time to deboard, which clearly shows how well-behaved Roger W. is in a public setting. </p>
<p>Instead of getting into an unnecessary verbal altercation with dog-hating passengers, you’d benefit by ignoring them and ensuring that your pet exhibits good manners, from airline check-in through the flight duration and on to baggage claim. </p>
<p>When walking inside the airport, keep your pet leashed or inside the carrier, and maintain distance from other people. Even at Los Angeles International Airport, we once encountered a young family of a culturally different background, with kids who were screaming and running away as we walked by. </p>
<h3>9. Not monitoring your dog throughout the flight </h3>
<p>Although you may feel relieved once your pet makes it on the plane, the real journey has just begun. A number of things can still go wrong up in the air, from restlessness to ventilation issues to accidents. Whether you have a perfectly healthy pup or a <a href="https://wetnoseescapades.com/flying-with-senior-dog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">senior dog</a> (like Roger W.), you should keep a vigilant eye on it and stay awake as much as possible. </p>
<p>Even if your little pooch is snoring on its back with four paws in the air, you shouldn’t zone out completely, in case of an emergency. Keep the volume low on your earphones, and check on your dog consistently throughout the flight.</p>
<p>Shortly after takeoff on a flight from Madrid to Geneva, Roger W. started panting and struggling, because the plane was incredibly stuffy. I immediately unzipped the carrier so he could have more air, but then got in trouble with the flight attendants for breaking the rules. However, since <a href="https://www.fodors.com/news/travel-tips/i-broke-the-rules-to-save-my-dog-from-dying-on-a-flight" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no flight is ever worth my dog’s life</a>, I was determined to prevail. In tears, I pleaded with two flight attendants for 15 minutes before they finally left us alone. </p>
<p><center>***</center></p>
<p>Traveling with Roger W. has not only deepened the bond between us but also allowed me to make new connections and lasting friendships around the world. It creates a more &#8220;local”&#8221; experience and takes me to places that I would not have gone without a dog. </p>
<p>With many airlines, accommodations, and establishments catering to pooches nowadays, traveling with your small dog has never been easier. As long as you make its health, comfort, and safety a priority, you can have the most amazing wanderlust experience together. </p>

                actually risen in value over the last few years. In this post, I show you where to go to maximize your
                budget and get the most out of every dollar!&lt;/p&gt;

<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 10/27/22 | October 27th, 2022</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never been easier to <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/the-ultimate-guide-to-traveling-when-you-have-no-money/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">travel with almost no money</a>. While &#8220;revenge travel&#8221; has driven up prices in the short term, those are already starting to drop back down to pre-COVID levels. And, with the spread of the sharing economy, plentiful <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/how-to-find-a-cheap-flight/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cheap flights</a>, and access to budget accommodation, getting away has never been more affordable.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an American, the strong dollar has made many places very cheap (or even cheaper) to visit. While that&#8217;s not great for other folks, it is good for us Americans, as we&#8217;re getting the best exchange rates we&#8217;ve had in years, and although absolute prices are up, you should really take advantage of this exchange rate to travel right now.</p>
<p>While there are lots of great destination options, I wanted to list a few of my favorites. These are places I think are the most interesting, fun, and easy to get to, and offer excellent value for your money. Here are 11 cheap places to travel on the US dollar:</p>

<h3 id="costa">1. Costa Rica</h3>
<p><img alt="A stunning beach and lush jungle along the coast of Costa Rica" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/cheapdollar3.jpg" width="675" /><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/my-favorite-destinations-in-costa-rica/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Costa Rica</a> is my favorite Central American country. Though it&#8217;s one of the most expensive in the region, your money will still go far here. It also strikes a balance between budget-friendly and safe, while still offering plenty of amazing sights and activities.</p>
<p>In this magical place, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/my-favorite-destinations-in-costa-rica/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">there is a ton to see and do</a>. You&#8217;ll find cloud forests, turtles, incredible surfing, volcanos, white-water rafting, fantastic nature preserves, deep-sea diving, and some of the happiest and nicest people around.</p>
<p>And on the budget travel side, you&#8217;ll only need about $50 USD per day, if you use hostels and buses and cook your own food; you&#8217;ll also be able to do a few budget activities, like snorkeling or hiking trips. As a bonus, flights from the US are also very cheap. If you&#8217;re flexible, you can find round-trips for under $300 USD.</p>
<p>On a mid-range budget of $100 USD per day, you can stay in an Airbnb, eat out more, enjoy a couple of drinks, take the occasional taxi, and do more paid activities, like guided tours, surf lessons, and museum visits. In short, you won&#8217;t want for anything on this budget!</p>

<h3 id="viet">2. Vietnam</h3>
<p><img alt="A small building nestled against the mountains near a lake in rural Vietnam" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/vietnamcheap.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Vietnam is one of the cheapest countries in an already budget-friendly region. If you budgeted $25 USD per day, you would want for little. Hostels are just a few bucks a day, and you can get delicious street food for around $1 USD. (You can visit the country comfortably quite comfortably for $50-75 USD per day if you&#8217;re looking for more luxury.)</p>
<p>Be sure to spend some time in the hectic capital of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/vietnam-travel-tips/hanoi/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hanoi</a>, and visit HaLong Bay when you&#8217;re in the north. In the south, don&#8217;t miss the Chu Chi Tunnels near <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/vietnam-travel-tips/ho-chi-minh-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ho Chi Minh City</a> (used by the Viet Cong during the war with the US).</p>
<p>For some adventurous activities, like canyoning and cliff jumping, head to Da Lat. If you&#8217;re looking for beaches, Nha Trang and Mui Ne should be at the top of your list!</p>

<h3 id="romania">3. Romania</h3>
<p><img alt="One of the many historic and picturesque castles in Transylvania, Romania" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/cheapus2a.jpg" width="675" /><br />
Not only is Romania an underrated destination in Europe, but it&#8217;s also a budget-friendly one. Bucharest is a modern, up-and-coming capital, and the entire Transylvania region is breathtaking. Bra?ov, my favorite city there, offers lots of history (including the infamous Bran Castle). Transportation is cheap, and both rideshares and hitchhiking are common. It&#8217;s a huge country, too so you can easily spend a few weeks and still just scratch the surface.</p>
<p>Backpackers can comfortably enjoy their time here for as little as $35-40 USD per day, which is a steal in Europe. And if you want to splurge and stay in hotels, eat out more, and enjoy a few drinks, you can easily do that for under $100 USD per day.</p>
<p>As more and more visitors come here to wait out their <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-legally-stay-in-europe-for-more-than-90-days/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Schengen Area visa restrictions</a>, it&#8217;s likely going to get more and more popular (and expensive), so try to visit while you can!</p>

<h3 id="india">4. India</h3>
<p><img alt="The iconic Taj Mahal on a sunny day in India surrounded by tourists" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/cheapdollar10.jpg" width="675" /><br />
While <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/13-favorite-things-india/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India</a> has always been a cheap country, with the US dollar doing so well, it&#8217;s even cheaper! You can get by on as little as $20-30 USD per day — often less! Mouthwatering meals can be found for under $2 USD, and accommodation is just $5-10 USD per night, depending on where you are.</p>
<p>Even if you go for mid-range accommodation and food, you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to spend more than $50 USD per day unless you&#8217;re staying at five-star resorts — and even they are quite affordable! While flights to India can be expensive, once you arrive, everything is a bargain.</p>
<p>Be sure not to miss the epic Taj Mahal, the laid-back beaches of Goa, the holy city of Varanasi, and sweeping metropolises like New Delhi and Mumbai.</p>
<h3 id="argentina">5. Argentina</h3>
<p><img alt="Torres Towers in Torres del Paine National Park, South America on a bright and sunny day" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/patagoniacamping3.jpg" width="675" /><br />
Argentina — filled with history, beautiful people, culture, wine, football, and outdoor wonders like <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/18-best-spots-patagonia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patagonia</a> — is one of my favorite countries in South America. And its capital, Buenos Aires, is considered one of the liveliest cities in the world. (Most people speak English, which makes it easier to get around.) I&#8217;ve never drunk so much wine or eaten as much steak as I did here (which blew my budget — but it was worth it!).</p>
<p>The only problem is the rampant inflation, so prices are always in flux. But even with that, you can still get by on around $40-50 USD per day by staying in hostels and sticking to cheap and free activities, like museum visits, hiking, and free walking tours.</p>
<p>Patagonia is the main draw here, offering stunning landscapes and world-class hiking. Nature lovers will also want to visit Iguazú Falls, the largest waterfall system in the world! And while guided hikes cost upwards of $450 USD for a multiday trek, that&#8217;s still super cheap considering it&#8217;s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

<h3 id="south">6. South Africa</h3>
<p><img alt="The lush hills and mountains of South Africa" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/cheapus2b.jpg" width="675" /><br />
Safaris, wineries, mountains, and an endless coastline that is perfect for road trips — that&#8217;s South Africa. As a backpacker or budget traveler, this country is a great destination to visit, as there are a lot of work opportunities as well as plenty of adventurous activities (and some great hiking) to keep you busy.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s true that South Africa struggles with corruption and petty crime, it has a booming tourism industry and a growing backpacker and digital nomad scene.</p>
<p>With $40-60 USD per day, you&#8217;ll be able to enjoy the amazing beaches and laid-back lifestyle that makes South Africa so appealing. While there are definitely cheaper places on the continent, you&#8217;ll get a lot of value here.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss hiking up Table Mountain or visiting the penguins when you&#8217;re in <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/cape-town-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cape Town</a>. And if you&#8217;re looking for a world-class safari experience, head to Kruger National Park!</p>
<p><em>Learn more and plan your trip with <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/south-africa-travel-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my in-depth guide to South Africa</a>!</em></p>
<h3 id="cambodia">7. Cambodia</h3>
<p><img alt="A monk in his robes wandering one of the many ancient temples at Angkor Wat in Cambodia" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/cheapdollar8.jpg" width="675" /><br />
Cambodia is one of my favorite countries in the world. The people are so incredibly welcoming, and <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/phnom-penh-same-same-but-different/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even after a long absence between visits</a>, I still found it to be one of the best destinations in Southeast Asia: affordable, friendly, and safe.</p>
<p>Prices have increased a little over the years, but not by much (it&#8217;s still cheaper than Thailand). Backpackers can easily get by for $40-50 USD or less per day. Street food is cheap and delicious (Phnom Penh is an amazing foodie city), and hostels cost under $10 USD per night. You can travel across much of the country via bus for $20 USD too.</p>
<p>Plus, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/cambodia-travel-tips/angkor-wat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Angkor Wat</a> is one of the most amazing historical sites in the world (it&#8217;s $37 USD to enter). Be sure to  also visit the Killing Fields and the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh for a sobering look at the country&#8217;s violent past.</p>

<h3 id="korea">8. South Korea</h3>
<p><img alt="People in traditional colorful clothing walking around in South Korea" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/cheapdollar7.jpg" width="675" /><br />
I don’t know why most people don’t talk about it, but if you want a cheap East Asian country with stunning countryside, South Korea is it. The country offers a lot of value!</p>
<p>When I went to South Korea a few years ago, I was stunned by how cheap everything was. Sure, it&#8217;s not as inexpensive as <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/southeast-asia-travel-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Southeast Asia</a>, but compared to Japan or Europe, it&#8217;s quite affordable. With the South Korean <em>won</em> at 1,372 KRW per USD and most everything costing only a few thousand <em>won</em>, I can’t imagine busting your budget here (unless you&#8217;re a huge foodie, because the cuisine here is delicious!).</p>
<p>My friend and I went out for Korean BBQ complete with drinks, and we each spent $8 USD. You can pick up bottles of beer at 7-11 for a couple of dollars. Hostels in Seoul start are just $15 USD per night (hotel rooms start at $30 USD per night). Backpackers can get by for only $50-60 USD here.</p>
<p>Be sure to indulge in Seoul&#8217;s culinary scene while you&#8217;re here, and visit the Gyeongbukgung Palace. For a more luxurious getaway, head to Jeju Island for beaches and some fun in the sun.</p>

<h3>9. Mexico</h3>
<p><img alt="A large Mexican flag in front of one of the many historic buildings in Mexico City, Mexico" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/mexicocitylove2.jpg" width="675" /><br />
I confess, I was late to the party on <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/mexico-travel-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico</a>. While I had visited some of the touristy areas, it wasn&#8217;t until recently that I finally explored beyond the resorts. And I loved every minute.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/mexico-travel-tips/mexico-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico City</a> is a world-class metropolis with amazing food and nightlife, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/mexico-travel-tips/oaxaca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oaxaca</a> has incredible historic sites and an abundance of delicious eateries (and all the mezcal you can drink), and the Yucatán Peninsula is perfect for road trips and swimming in secluded cenotes (sinkholes).</p>
<p>While the country gets a bad rap in the US (thanks to overzealous media coverage), it&#8217;s actually much safer — and cheaper — than people think. Travelers can get by on as little as $50 USD per day ($80-120 USD if you want hotels and not hostels), and flights from the US are often just $200 USD round-trip.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s a great option for US travelers who are short on time but still want to explore somewhere fun, sunny, and cheap.</p>

<h3 id="uk">10. The United Kingdom</h3>
<p><img alt="Buckingham Palace and a classic red telephone booth in London, England" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/cheapuk1a.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
In years past, the British pound (GBP) has been worth up to double the US dollar. That&#8217;s not the case anymore. Still struggling post-Brexit, it&#8217;s now worth just 20% more than the dollar, if that. So, while the UK isn&#8217;t exactly a cheap place to visit, the weakened pound and strong dollar mean that now you&#8217;ll get a lot more value compared to years past. Backpackers can get around for as little as $75 USD per day by sticking to hostels, free museums, and cheap pub food.</p>

<h3>11. Everywhere!</h3>
<p><img alt="The colorful buildings of Copenhagen along the water as someone cycles by" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/hostelscopenhagen.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Right now, everywhere is &#8220;discounted&#8221; if you&#8217;re an American. The euro is at an all-time low against the US dollar and the pound is weak, as are the yen, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand dollars, etc. etc. It&#8217;s an especially good time to travel to countries that are usually expensive, such as Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and New Zealand. Your dollars will go much further than in years past, so you should really take advantage of that opportunity, because you don&#8217;t really know how long this will last!</p>
<p><center>***</center>A strong US dollar makes traveling the world much cheaper than it would be otherwise — especially if you want to head to Europe and visit some &#8220;traditionally expensive&#8221; destinations. And while a strong dollar doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;free,&#8221; it can definitely help you travel longer or in more luxury.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss out on the opportunity while you can. Because who knows how long the strong dollar will last?</p>

<h4>Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>
<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />
Find a cheap flight by using <a href="https://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/214481/1027991/13416?subId1=%26currency%3DUSD&#038;associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.com%2F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a>. It&#8217;s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. </p>
<p><strong>Book Your Accommodation</strong><br />
You can book your hostel with <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hostelworld</a>. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use <a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=362916" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. </p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget Travel Insurance</strong><br />
Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It&#8217;s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I&#8217;ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance/?referenceID=24768462&#038;campaign=footer-blue-box&#038;utm_source=24768462&#038;utm_medium=Ambassador" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SafetyWing</a> (best for everyone)

<p><em>House sitting is one of the best ways to lower your travel costs as a long-term traveler. To help you learn more about house sitting, our lead content editor and researcher, Sam, shares her tips and insights from years of traveling the world as a house sitter.</em></p>
<p>For years, I lived the life of many budget travelers’ dreams: traveling full-time and living rent-free in idyllic locations, like the US Virgin Islands; cosmopolitan cities, like NYC and London; tourist hot spots, like Granada, Spain; and many off-the-beaten-path places, like the forests of North Carolina. </p>
<p>I stayed everywhere from luxury condos with literal hot tubs on the roof to solar-powered homes with outdoor showers. </p>
<p>I got to hang out with the sweetest pets, from a cuddly kitten named Marshmallow to a hilarious parrot called Sunshine. </p>
<p>I also made friends with locals around the world, getting tips on the best lesser-known places to eat, and truly living like a resident in each destination. </p>
<p>When I paint this picture to fellow avid travelers, the immediate response is, “What a dream life! How do I live like that?!” </p>
<p>The answer is to house sit. </p>
<p>House sitting is when you take care of someone’s pets and home while they’re traveling in exchange for accommodation. No money is exchanged between parties, as it’s a mutually beneficial arrangement:  you get a place to stay at no cost, and the owner gets home and pet care at no cost. (I avoid using the term “free accommodation,” as it implies that there’s no work involved, which is not the case.) </p>
<p>House sitting is gaining in popularity, but it’s still a little-known landscape for so many travelers. While I’m usually met with excitement when I discuss this topic with people who are not familiar with it, that also often comes hand in hand with skepticism — and understandably so. There are a lot of variables to consider, and if you’ve never met anyone who’s done it before, it can be easy to think that it sounds too good to be true. </p>
<p>I’m here to tell you that house sitting in order to travel at a reduced cost is absolutely attainable. You’ll not only remove most accommodation expenses (you might still have to pay for a night here and there, depending on how long you’re on the road), but also connect with locals wherever you go (the people for whom you are house sitting), feel a sense of home on the road, and often get other perks as well, like a vehicle to use. </p>
<p>The only prerequisite is that you must love animals, as 99% of gigs involve pet care. But if you can do that, then you are good to go!</p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to show you how to start house sitting, so you can learn about the process and see what’s required before jumping in and giving it a try yourself.</p>
<h3>1. Determine your goals and preferences </h3>
<p><img alt="House sitter Sam and a cat posing for a fun photo" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/housesitnew1.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
At this point, you might be anxious to dive right in, find a gig, and hit the ground running. But I promise that you’ll set yourself up for a better experience if you take some time to determine what you want to get out of house sitting. </p>
<p>Your goals will greatly impact the choices you make along your house sitting journey, and whether you walk away with a positive experience. (Because yes, like with anything travel-related, there’s always the potential for things to go wrong — I’ll share how to minimize the likelihood of this happening later.)</p>
<p>It’s pretty much a given that if you’re interested in house sitting, your goal is to reduce your travel costs so that you can travel more and/or longer. </p>
<p>But do you want to house sit only locally, or around the world? Are you scoping out places where you might eventually purchase a home, take a sabbatical, aspire to travel full-time, or simply looking to reduce your costs on a weekend getaway? </p>
<p>These are all common reasons. Think about which ones apply to you. </p>
<p>For me, I wanted to extend my travels for as long as possible while freelance writing, growing my travel blog and podcast, and seeing what it was like to live in different places around the world. I couldn’t have done any of these things without house sitting, which lowered my costs so significantly (after all, accommodation is usually one’s biggest travel expenditure) that I could keep traveling despite not earning much money yet.</p>
<p>In addition to your goals, think about your preferences. Do you feel more comfortable with dogs or cats? Do you prefer the city or the countryside? Do you have an ideal length of time that you want to spend in each place? </p>
<p>In order to work effectively on the road while still getting to explore each place, I prioritized longer house sits (around 1–3 months). I also prefer urban environments where I can explore on two feet or two wheels rather than needing a vehicle, so I mainly searched for gigs in cities. </p>
<p>These are just a few variables that will help you narrow down which opportunities you consider. You’ll also likely develop these preferences over time as you figure out what works best for you.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Sign up for a website </h3>
<p>If you’re serious about house sitting, your first order of business is to sign up for a website. These platforms connect pet owners and house sitters to arrange mutually beneficial stays. They’re the easiest and most direct way to start. </p>
<p>Pet owners put up listings with their location, the dates they need a house sitter, their pets and type of care needed, any home care needed, and (ideally) photos of their home and pets. Potential house sitters create profiles listing their experience, references, why they want to house sit, photos, and any other details they want to include. </p>
<p>House sitters respond to opportunities that they’re interested in (pet owners can also reach out to house sitters privately), sparking a conversation that may eventually lead to both parties coming to an agreement.</p>
<p>Most websites operate on a membership basis, meaning that members must pay a fee to be a part of the community and to be able to arrange gigs. </p>
<p>Many would-be house sitters balk at the idea of paying a yearly membership fee for these websites. Isn’t house sitting supposed to be free? </p>
<p>But when you think about the amount of money that you could save, it’s a no-brainer. Even the most expensive website, <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5759&#038;awinaffid=509047&#038;clickref=&#038;p=" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a>, still only costs the equivalent of a couple of nights of accommodation. You only have to do one stay per year to recoup your costs, and chances are that you’ll be doing a lot more than that, even as an occasional house sitter. </p>
<p>There are a variety of websites to choose from, but the main ones are these: </p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5759&#038;awinaffid=509047&#038;clickref=&#038;p=" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters.com</a> (<em>starts at $129 USD/year</em>) – This is the biggest such website worldwide, with thousands of active listings all around the globe. It started and is based in the UK, so you’ll find the highest number of gigs there, though Europe, the US, and Australia are also well represented. If you are open to house-sitting anywhere in the world, this is the site to choose. <a href="https://www.alternativetravelers.com/trustedhousesitters-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">You can read my review here if you want to learn more</a>.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.nomador.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nomador.com</a> (<em>$99 USD/year</em>) – Nomador centers on opportunities in Europe (mostly France), though you can also sometimes find some in the US and Australia too. There’s a free “Discovery” option, so you can look at what’s available, as well as a “Stopovers” feature, which is like Couchsurfing, so you can find a place to stay with members of the Nomador community between your gigs. </p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.mindmyhouse.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MindMyHouse.com</a> (<em>$20 USD/year</em>) – This site has a low fee to join, a fair number of listings (primarily in North America and Europe), and a well-laid-out website. </p>
<p>In addition to the above websites that cover multiple countries, there are also country-specific ones, such as House Sitters America, House Sitters UK, House Sitters Canada, etc. If you’re only interested in house sitting in a particular locale, these websites usually have way less competition than the bigger players, making it easier to get your first gig. They also have lower annual membership costs, making it a more palatable choice for getting your feet wet.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Create your profile</h3>
<p><img alt="Sam Anthony's profile on Trusted Housesitters" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/THSprofile.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve signed up for a website, it’s time to create your profile. Above is an example from my <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5759&#038;awinaffid=509047&#038;clickref=&#038;p=" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> account.</p>
<p>Your house-sitting profile is like your résumé. This is where pet owners look to learn more about you, and it’s essential to detail any and all pet-care experience you have. Have you done any house- or pet-sitting for friends and family? Many people have looked in on a neighbor’s cat while they were away or taken a family member’s dog on walks. </p>
<p>Include anything you can to show the breadth of your pet-care experience (though of course be honest). Any relevant home-care experience or other skills (such as if you speak another language) are worth mentioning here as well. </p>
<p>You’ll also want to include a bit about yourself, with information about why you want to house sit, what you like to spend time doing, and anything else, so as to paint a portrait of yourself. </p>
<p>Finally, choose some photos of you (ideally with pets) to round out your profile, so that the owners can see who you are!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Ask for references </h3>
<p><img alt="Sam, the lead researcher for Nomadic Matt, posing with a cat while house sitting abroad" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/housesitsam3.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Now that you’ve filled out your profile, it’s time to seek references to beef up your profile. </p>
<p>Once you start house sitting through these websites, you’ll get “native” references showing that the gig was arranged through the website, increasing your trust factor for people you might house sit for in the future. </p>
<p>But most websites also allow you to get “external” references to show that you’re a trustworthy person before your first “official” gig. Ideally, you’ll have done some kind of pet-sitting before and can ask these folks to provide a reference. But references can also come from work colleagues, a landlord, or anyone else that can speak to your responsible character. </p>
<p>These references are key in the beginning, as being vouched for can be a powerful trust indicator. Don’t skip this step!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Browse and apply for house sitting gigs </h3>
<p><img alt="A dog and a car chilling in a cozy living room together during a house sit" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/housesitnew2.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
So you’re all set up with your profile and references filled out. Now comes the exciting part: browsing for and applying for gigs! </p>
<p>Spend some time looking through the listings on the website(s) you’ve joined. If you find one that sounds good to you — and you’re available for the time frame — don’t hesitate to apply! Gigs, especially in desirable areas, can go very quickly, so don’t dawdle if you’ve found one that you’re interested in. </p>
<p>Remember: An application is not an agreement to house sit; it’s simply a statement of interest.</p>
<p>In your message to the pet owner, include a bit about why you’re interested, highlight your relevant experience, and indicate that you’d love to set up a time to chat further about the opportunity. You don’t need to write an essay here, just enough to pique their interest and have them look at your profile for more information.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Arrange a video chat </h3>
<p>While you might be so excited to start that you may want to agree to an opportunity as soon as it’s offered to you, don’t skip this important step. In a quick video call, both parties can ask questions to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the arrangement is a good fit. </p>
<p>As a house sitter, you’ll want to ask questions about pet and home care to ensure that you can (and want) to do it, as well as the immediate area around the house or apartment, home amenities (always ask about Wi-Fi!), and anything else that you’re itching to know. </p>
<p>Every single time that I hear of a <a href="https://www.alternativetravelers.com/avoid-bad-house-sits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">house sitting gig gone wrong</a> (while it’s rare, it does happen), it’s due to mismatched expectations that usually could have been avoided with a direct and honest initial conversation.</p>
<p>I absolutely never agree to house sit without a video call. This is a personal choice, and some people do forgo this step, but it has never steered me wrong in the past, and personally, I’d rather be safe than sorry. A video call takes 20-30 minutes and does wonders for putting both parties at ease — and getting excited about the gig! </p>
<p>After years in a pandemic, we’re all familiar (maybe too familiar) with Zoom these days, so there is (in my opinion) no reason why both parties shouldn’t be able to sit down face-to-face for a brief conversation. </p>
<p>Some things that you might want to ask in the video chat step above and/or leading up to the gig include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the pet-care routine (e.g., when meals are, if walks are needed, etc.)? </li>
<li>Are there any quirks about the pets that you should know about (e.g., for dogs, how do they do on walks around other dogs, etc.)? </li>
<li>Do they have a regular vet (and what is the procedure, including payment, if a pet needs to go)?</li>
<li>What’s the neighborhood like? </li>
<li>What are the pet owners’ departure and arrival times? Do they want you to come the night before they leave or on the day of departure? </li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a starting list of some basics, but if you have specific needs or questions, be sure to ask them. You don’t want to be left wondering and finding out something important after you get there.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Agree to the gig </h3>
<p>Assuming all has gone well in the above steps, it’s time to agree to house sit! </p>
<p>Make sure that you do so through the website that you’ve connected on, for a couple of reasons. Many websites have protection that kicks in should something go wrong, but only if you’ve confirmed the gig through the website. </p>
<p>Protection for house sitters and homeowners varies by website (check the fine print of the one you sign up for) but can include damage protection (you accidentally drop an expensive glass) and sit protection insurance (which can help cover nightly pet care or accommodation costs if the gig gets canceled at the last minute). </p>
<p>You’ll also want to be able to ask for on-platform references after you’ve successfully completed the job. You can only get those by confirming the gig through the house-sitting website.</p>
<p>And once everything is confirmed, don’t hesitate to keep in touch. If you have any additional questions or concerns, ask them! Direct and honest communication is key to successful house sitting, so don’t be shy.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. Have a fantastic time </h3>
<p><img alt="A cat resting on a pile of packing cubes during a house sitting experience" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/housesitnew3.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
While house sitting is a big responsibility, remember why you’re doing this in the first place — to explore a new place and have fun! </p>
<p>That being said, always honor your commitment. Do not back out at the last minute because you found a more glamorous gig somewhere else, you changed your travel plans on a whim or anything else that’s not a legitimate emergency. </p>
<p>If you want to stay spontaneous on the road, then house sitting isn’t a good option — or at least not all the time. While some travelers do this full-time, the vast majority do not. Some nomads mix in periods of house sitting between other more flexible accommodation options, while others aren’t nomadic at all and simply house sit to enjoy a different, more affordable way of traveling. </p>
<p>Find out what works for you and create your own ideal travel style.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Follow up by asking for a review </h3>
<p><img alt="A Trusted Housesitters review example" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/samhousesittingreview.jpeg" /></p>
<p>After every gig (but especially as you’re first getting started), don’t forget to ask for a review. </p>
<p>It’s essential to build your portfolio of references, as this makes you a more trustworthy and competitive candidate for the next opportunities that you apply for. Give the folks you house-sat for some time to settle back in from their trip, and if they haven’t submitted a review after a week, send along a gentle reminder that it’d be greatly appreciated if they could leave a quick review. </p>
<p>Most homeowners don’t realize how important these reviews are to house sitters but are more than happy to help when you ask them for one.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>10. Reflect, rinse, and repeat</h3>
<p>Every gig is a learning experience, and this goes double when you’re first starting out. Take stock of what worked and if there was anything that didn’t. This will help you refine your approach for the future so that you can happily house-sit for as long as you want! </p>
<p><center>***</center></p>
<p>House sitting can be an incredible way to travel at a reduced cost, make new friends (both human and furry), and see the world in a different way. While it does come with some planning and a great deal of responsibility, the rewards can be huge. With these tips, you’ve already got a leg up. </p>
<p>Happy house-sitting! </p>

<p><strong>Posted</strong>: 11/4/2022 | November 4th, 2022</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/planning-a-trip/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I love trip planning</a>: outlining routes, researching things to see and do, reading travel books. While I always end up changing my plans on the fly, trip research gets me inspired about where I’m going and helps me know what options I have when I land, even if I change plans ten times over the course of a day.</p>
<p>Some of the info I find is on blogs, some is on social media or in guidebooks. I’m constantly having to jump between platforms to look stuff up and compare notes and suggestions. It’s not convenient.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a new tool out there that can help travelers find the best things to see and do on their trips (and at home too). It will bring all your research together in one place.</p>
<p>It’s called <a href="https://bestlist.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bestlist</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Bestlist?</h3>
<p><a href="https://bestlist.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bestlist</a> is a search engine focused solely on helping you discover the best of anything. Restaurants, beaches, activities, excursions, historic sites — you name it.</p>
<p>They crawl the web and aggregate millions of data points, reviews, and comments, and process it all with their proprietary machine-learning models. They measure popularity, sentiment, and more, providing users with the best options for each search query.</p>
<p>Whether you’re planning a trip and looking for inspiration and suggestions or just looking for a place to eat in your hometown, Bestlist can help.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Bestlist.com homepage" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/bestlist1.png" /></p>
<p>Once you conduct a search on Bestlist, you’ll see that each result includes a short description and a link to an external site. You can then browse your list and save your favorite results to a collection. You can have collections for anything: websites, places to visit, restaurants, things to do, etc.</p>
<p>So far, I have four collections (they’re all travel related of course):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bestlist.com/collection/matt-fgtzx/things-to-do-in-amsterdam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Things to Do in Amsterdam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bestlist.com/collection/matt-fgtzx/the-best-of-thailand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Best of Thailand</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bestlist.com/collection/matt-fgtzx/best-travel-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Best Travel Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bestlist.com/collection/matt-fgtzx/best-travel-credit-cards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Best Credit Cards for Travelers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The more you use the site, the more things you can add to your collections. Collections are easy to make, reorder, and expand too. (More on this below.)</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of Nomadic Matt's travel collections on Bestlist.com" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/bestlist2.png" /></p>
<h3>Three features that make Bestlist stand out</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick look at three other features of <a href="https://bestlist.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bestlist</a> that I think really help the platform stand out from all the others:</p>
<p><strong>1. Voting</strong>: If you feel strongly about a search result, you can upvote or downvote the listing to voice your opinion. The more upvotes something gets, the higher it will appear in the search results (and the more downvotes it gets, the lower it will appear). When you vote, you’ll be asked to state why you voted, which gives other users better insights into the listing. This means you not only get to help shape the results but see why other people voted as they did. This makes the results much more transparent than simply a thumbs up or thumbs down. </li>
<p><strong>2. Submissions</strong>: If you find that something is missing from a particular search result, you can submit it as a suggestion using a button at the bottom. Simply add the name and URL of the new listing, and it will be reviewed and published if it makes the cut. So, if there’s something cool from your hometown that’s missing, or you discover an awesome website worth sharing, you have the potential to add it to help improve the platform for everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>3. Privacy</strong>: Your personal data is not shared with advertisers or other third parties. This is a big deal, because, as we all know, search engine data is full of personal information about you. I like this feature a lot.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to make a collection</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick overview of how to get started building your own collections on Bestlist:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Once you’ve made an account, simply visit the homepage and search for whatever it is you’re looking for. In this example, we’ll assume you’re going to NYC and want to find some places to eat. So, search for “best restaurants in New York City” and choose the “list” option.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of Nomadic Matt's searching for information on Bestlist.com" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/bestlist3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now that you have a list of suggestions, scroll down to browse. If you see a place that looks interesting, click the “Collect” option to save it to a collection. If you haven’t started a “Restaurants in NYC” collection, you can do so at this point.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the results of a search on the website Bestlist.com" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/bestlist4.png" /></p>
<p>On the right side, you’ll also see related searches. So, if you also want to look for museums or accommodations in NYC, you have the option to do so as well (and build collections for any of those results too).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Once you review the results and save everything to your collection, you’re all set! All the restaurants you chose will be listed in your collection, where you can view them anytime (and also add more, rearrange, or delete some if you like). If you want to share this collection with your travel buddies (or the general audience on Bestlist), you can make it public. Otherwise, if it’s just for you, you can keep it private.</p>

<h4>Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>
<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />
Find a cheap flight by using <a href="https://skyscanner.pxf.io/c/214481/1027991/13416?subId1=%26currency%3DUSD&#038;associateid=AFF_TRA_19354_00001&#038;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skyscanner.com%2F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a>. It&#8217;s my favorite search engine because it searches websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. </p>
<p><strong>Book Your Accommodation</strong><br />
You can book your hostel with <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hostelworld</a>. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use <a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=362916" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> as it consistently returns the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. </p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget Travel Insurance</strong><br />
Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It&#8217;s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I&#8217;ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance/?referenceID=24768462&#038;campaign=footer-blue-box&#038;utm_source=24768462&#038;utm_medium=Ambassador" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SafetyWing</a> (best for everyone)
<li><a href="https://www.insuremytrip.com/?linkid=GB841615" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Insure My Trip</a> (for those 70 and over)</li>
<li><a href="https://medjetassist.com/nomadicmatt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Medjet</a> (for additional evacuation coverage)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Want to travel for free?</strong><br />

<strong>Posted</strong>: 11/7/22 | November 7th, 2022</p>
<p>As an avid travel hacker, I’m always looking for new ways to earn more points and miles through my everyday spending. As a result, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-hacking-1-million-miles-per-year/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I earn over one million points every year</a>, allowing me to enjoy all kinds of free flights and hotel stays, upgrades, lounge access, elite status, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-hacking-101/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Travel hacking</a> has saved me thousands and thousands of dollars over the years, and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to travel as much without it.</p>
<p>However, there’s traditionally been one huge expense that has always been hard to earn points for: rent. </p>
<p>For years, travel hackers have taken advantage of temporary offers that waive credit card fees or gone through complex procedures to pay their rent so they could get points. </p>
<p>But these maneuvers were all hit or miss and never lasted long. Thousands of potential points continued to be left on the table.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a card called <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/card/referral/MATT-7BSTK?utm_source=aff&#038;utm_medium=partner&#038;utm_campaign=Nomadic-Matt&#038;APP_SOURCE=partner_paid_marketing&#038;lang=en&#038;locale=en_US&#038;sub_channel=PRT&#038;vendor_code=BL" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bilt</a> came out. And it has changed the game.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Bilt?</h3>
<p><img alt="Bilt credit card" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/mattbilt.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" width="300" /><a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/card/referral/MATT-7BSTK?utm_source=aff&#038;utm_medium=partner&#038;utm_campaign=Nomadic-Matt&#038;APP_SOURCE=partner_paid_marketing&#038;lang=en&#038;locale=en_US&#038;sub_channel=PRT&#038;vendor_code=BL" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bilt</a> is a credit card that allows you to earn points when you pay your rent (as well as on everyday purchases). You then use those points like you would any other rewards program: you can use them to book travel directly, you can transfer them to travel partners, or you can use some of the other redemption options. </p>
<p>There are two ways to earn points with the card: by renting a Bilt Alliance property, or by using the Bilt World Elite Mastercard®. </p>
<p>Bilt Alliance properties form a network of two million units across the US. But I&#8217;m not going to focus on that. I&#8217;m going to talk about its credit card.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How does the Bilt reward card work?</h3>
<p>Once you open a Bilt Mastercard® (which is issued by Wells Fargo and has no annual fee), you go to the Bilt app or website to set up your recurring monthly rental payments. </p>
<p>Bilt then creates a unique bank account tied to your Bilt credit card so that your rent is paid with an e-check rather than through your credit card. This bank account is basically a legal “dummy” account created as a workaround for credit card processing fees. You do not use it for anything else, and you do not withdraw or deposit money from it.</p>
<p>Whenever these unique routing and account numbers are used to pay rent, your Bilt Mastercard® is charged for the same amount. (You still have to connect your personal bank account to pay off the card each month.) </p>
<p>And, if your property is old-school and only accepts checks, you can still pay with your Bilt card through the Bilt Rewards app, and Bilt will send a check on your behalf.</p>
<p>It all takes about five minutes to set up. When you&#8217;re done, you’ll be earning points on your rent. I use it, so I don&#8217;t leave any points on the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bilt Reward Perks</h3>
<p>Once your account is set up, you’ll start earning one point per dollar spent using the Bilt credit card on rent payments, up to 50,000 points each calendar year. While the mileage needed for free flights varies drastically depending on many factors, if you play your cards right, that many points could get you a free round-trip flight from <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/new-york-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York</a> to <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/england-travel-tips/london/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London</a>. </p>
<p>And, while earning points for rent payments is Bilt’s main draw, you’ll also earn two points per dollar spent on travel (when booked directly or through the Bilt Travel portal) and three points per dollar spent on dining. You’ll get one point per dollar on all other purchases. </p>
<p>Just note that you have to make five purchases per month (with no minimum spending requirement) to earn these rewards. </p>
<p>You can transfer points 1:1 to travel partners, including American Airlines, United, Emirates, Hawaiian, Virgin Atlantic, Air Canada, Air France/KLM, Hyatt, and IHG. </p>
<p>The fact that they transfer to American Airlines and Hyatt really sets this card apart (besides the rent thing). No one transfers to American, so this is a huge selling point for this card, because it&#8217;s the only way to get AA points without having an AA card. And earning Hyatt points allows you to have a way out of the Chase system. </p>
<p>You can also redeem points for fitness classes, like SoulCycle, Solidcore, Rumble, and Y7, and for items in the Bilt Collection, a curated selection of artisan home décor items. But redeeming for fitness classes comes out to around one point per cent — you get a better redemption on travel purchases.</p>
<p>Additionally, purchases also help you earn status in the Bilt Rewards program, based on the total points earned annually. </p>
<p>The tiers for those Bilt Rewards are as follows (subsequent tiers include everything in the aforementioned ones): </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blue</strong>: Earn points on rent and the ability to transfer them 1:1 to travel partners</li>
<li><strong>Silver</strong> (25,000 points per year): 10% bonus points when you sign a new lease or renew your lease, and interest on your points balance (at the FDIC published national savings interest rate)</li>
<li><strong>Gold</strong> (50,000 points per year): 25% bonus points for new leases/renewals and access to a home ownership concierge (who will walk you through the home-buying process)</li>
<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (100,000 points per year): 50% bonus points for new leases/renewals and a free gift from the Bilt Collection of home décor items</li>
</ul>
<p>While the perks in the higher tiers aren’t terribly exciting, they’re a nice way to earn even more points if they apply to you. But, even at the base level, you can still take advantage of Bilt’s main attraction: earning points on rent. </p>
<p>In addition to earning points, the card also gives you: </p>
<ul>
<li>Trip cancellation protection and interruption coverage</li>
<li>Trip delay reimbursement (for delays of six hours or more)</li>
<li>Car rental collision coverage </li>
<li>Cell phone protection (up to $800 USD)</li>
<li>No foreign transaction fees </li>
<li>DashPass credits for a free three-months and $5 USD off your first DoorDash order each month </li>
<li>$5 USD in Lyft credits each month after taking three rides that month</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who is this card for?</h3>
<p>This card is suited for anyone who wants to earn points on their monthly rent. Once you set up the online payments (you can also set up auto-pay) and use your card five times a month, it’s largely a “set it and forget it” kind of card. With no annual fee, you have nothing to lose and only points to gain. </p>
<p>The card is especially geared toward travelers and restaurant-goers, since it offers 2x points spent on travel and 3x points on dining out. It’s best paired with other <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/picking-a-travel-credit-card/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">travel credit cards</a> that have better perks, nice welcome bonuses, and higher earning rates, though. </p>
<p>I will probably start using the Bilt card instead of my Chase Sapphire, because I get a lot of Chase points through business spending, and I&#8217;m aiming to fly to Japan next year, so I want those AA points (AA is a partner with Japan Airlines).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Who is this card not for?</h3>
<p>As with any travel credit card, you should not get the Bilt card if you’re already carrying a balance or plan to carry a balance. Interest rates for travel credit cards are notoriously high, and the Bilt card is no different. The points just aren’t worth it if you’re paying interest each month. </p>
<p>This card is also not for anyone with poor credit, as you need good or excellent credit to qualify. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bilt card won’t be for anyone looking for one with a big welcome bonus (as there is none), and it does count toward Chase’s 5/24 rule (you can’t open more than five Chase cards within 24 months). If you’ve already opened five Chase cards or want to open more, you might want to skip this one for now. </p>
<p>In sum, if you are a renter and want to earn points on this major monthly expenditure, then it’s worth considering the Bilt card. It’s completely free, and easy to set up, so there’s really nothing to lose. Even if your rent isn’t particularly high, points are points, and the Bilt card could be a nice additional resource for earning those coveted points and miles (especially if you fly American Airlines, as this is one of their only transfer partners). </p>

<p>As the only rewards card that offers points on rent completely for free, <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/card/referral/MATT-7BSTK?utm_source=aff&#038;utm_medium=partner&#038;utm_campaign=Nomadic-Matt&#038;APP_SOURCE=partner_paid_marketing&#038;lang=en&#038;locale=en_US&#038;sub_channel=PRT&#038;vendor_code=BL" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bilt</a> is a welcome new player in the travel space. In my opinion, it’s really a no-brainer if you pay rent, so you can start working toward some free flights and hotel stays! </p>

<strong>Posted</strong>: 11/14/22 | November 14th, 2022</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve never been to India. I know. Crazy, right? It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want to go but life has just always gotten in the way. However, India is a place a lot of people visit and, since I can&#8217;t write about it, I want to bring in someone who can: my friend Mariellen Ward. She&#8217;d a travel writer who has been going to India since 2005 and runs the website <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breathedreamgo</a>. We&#8217;ve known each other since 2010. Today, she&#8217;s going to share some tips on how to visit India for first-time visitors. </em></p>
<p>I will never forget my first time visiting India. My first car trip in Delhi felt like a roller-coaster ride. Cars and trucks of every size, overloaded bicycles and motorcycles, and even the occasional bullock cart, seemed to be coming at me from every direction. No one was paying any attention to lanes or the rules of the road. Vehicles were driving the wrong way. I couldn’t make sense of what was happening.</p>
<p>I had heard about the “sensory overload” travelers feel in India, and now I was experiencing it. It was exciting and nerve-wracking in equal measure. And just a taste of things to come. </p>
<p>I spent six months crisscrossing the subcontinent on my first trip, back in 2005 and was often overwhelmed by the huge crowds, the foreign traditions, the perplexing bureaucracy, the mind-boggling complexity, and the bewildering culture shock.</p>
<p>These things combined make India a challenging — though very exciting and rewarding —destination. </p>
<p>However, if you read and follow these travel tips for first-time visitors, they could help smooth out some of the more disorienting bumps. </p>
<h3>1. Slow down</h3>
<p>It takes time and some know-how to successfully navigate in India. This is not a place for hurried travel. Don’t try and see as much as you can; that is not the right approach. It’s tiring to travel in India, and the object should be to experience it, not to check things off a list. </p>
<p>As a general rule, for every two weeks you are in India, pick one region. For a one-month trip, just pick two regions — say, two weeks in <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/guide-places-to-visit-in-rajasthan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rajasthan</a> and <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/ideal-two-week-kerala-itinerary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two weeks in Kerala</a>. You can even sit in one place and still not miss anything. No matter what, if you are in India, you will experience India. </p>
<h3>2. Adjust your attitude</h3>
<p><img alt="A solo female traveler in India posing near a historic wall overlooking a town" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/indiatips2.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Let yourself fully experience India. There’s a quote from the movie <em><a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/movie-review-the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</a></em> that sums it up: “India hits you like a wave. If you resist, you will be knocked down. But if you dive into it, you will be alright.” </p>
<p>Likewise, accept that things will not go as planned. Cultivate the philosophy that things happen the way they are supposed to, not the way they are planned. This attitude can lead to the most marvelous adventures. </p>
<h3>3. Be careful who you trust</h3>
<p>Having said that it’s a good idea to be open, a healthy level of skepticism also comes in really handy in India. There are many con men there, especially in the travel and hospitality sector. They have a sixth sense for first-time visitors and will try and take advantage. </p>
<p>So, learn the prices by asking locals and other travelers before negotiating with auto-rickshaw drivers and market vendors. Don’t believe drivers — or random people you come across at airports, train stations, and tourist attractions — who tell you things such as your hotel burned down, or the train you want was canceled. </p>
<p>Often, an opportunity to make money off of you will spur creative tactics, and some of these scams can easily catch you off guard. Once, I was looking for a new iPhone case and the vendor showed me one and told me it was made by Apple. But a close look revealed four spelling mistakes in one short sentence engraved inside the case.</p>
<h3>4. Practice safe travel</h3>
<p><img alt="A solo female traveler in India exploring a historic old building" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/indiatips3.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
India has a reputation as a daunting travel destination, especially for women. However, I have spent many years in India as a female solo traveler, and though I have been uncomfortable, I have never felt really unsafe or threatened. Reported crimes against tourists are relatively rare, but harassment, staring, pickpocketing, and getting ripped off are common. </p>
<p>There are also anecdotal reports of women being molested, especially in busy, crowded places. Follow basic precautions and safe travel strategies, and use common sense in India. </p>
<p>Here are several safety travel tips (please read my <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/my-top-tips-for-women-travelling-in-india/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">top tips for women traveling in India</a> for more details):</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a local SIM card so that you can make local calls and stay in touch.</li>
<li>Research carefully where you want to go, ensuring it is an area frequented by other travelers, with good infrastructure and hotels.</li>
<li>Plan your travel so you don’t arrive late at night; travel during daylight hours only.</li>
<li>Be careful when posting to social media, so that you are not revealing your current location. </li>
<li>Stay alert to your surroundings, and keep a close eye on your handbag and luggage.</li>
<li>Keep the Tourist Helpline number handy and call if you need any assistance: 1-800-111363.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Try a small group tour</h3>
<p>For your first time in India, try taking a small group or custom tour to help you get your feet wet. My company, <a href="https://indiaforbeginners.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India for Beginners</a>, was founded to help women travel safely and well in India. We offer a few small group tours, but we specialize in creating custom tours and providing a high level of personal service, such as meeting travelers at the airport and assigning a tour manager who is available 24/7. We hold your hand in India! </p>
<h3>6. Take the train</h3>
<p>Taking a <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/indian-trains-planes-automobiles-railways/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">train in India</a> is a great experience and should not be missed. However, you need some basic knowledge about the classes and the trains. You may not want to dive into sleeper class or general class immediately; I would recommend 2AC (second class with air conditioning) or CC (chair car). Or even 1AC (first class with air conditioning) or EC (executive chair car). </p>
<p>Shatabdi and Rajdhani trains are among the best in India, so try and book one of these. Overnight trains can be a problem because they don’t clean the toilets at night, so keep that in mind when you book. </p>
<h3>7. Eat the food</h3>
<p>India is one of the world’s great culinary destinations, and first-time visitors should not shy away from trying all the delicious cuisine on offer, even street food. Some of the <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/20-famous-indian-foods-recipes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">famous Indian items</a> you shouldn’t miss are masala chai, sweet lassi, biryani, pakoras, dosas, and sweets such as gulab jamun and kheer. </p>
<p>It’s hard to avoid getting sick in India, though, because you never know when a tainted item will cross your plate. It could be at a street stall or a five-star restaurant. However, you can reduce the chances of getting sick by following these basic rules: </p>
<ul>
<li>Drink filtered or bottled water only. </li>
<li>Watch for undistilled water in ice or sauces.</li>
<li>Avoid salad and other raw food unless you can peel it (such as an orange or banana). </li>
<li>Eat only food that is freshly cooked. </li>
<li>Look for busy stalls and restaurants with high turnover. </li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Get a local SIM card</h3>
<p>Everything in India runs on WhatsApp, one-time password (OTP) verification, and text messages. Because of this, you need a local number. To do so, get a local SIM at the airport when you arrive. Still, you may have trouble paying for things online with a foreign credit card, as India requires OTP verification, and getting registered with Indian Railways so you buy train tickets online is nearly impossible. </p>
<h3>9. Remember where you are</h3>
<p><img alt="A solo woman in India standing near two painted elephants" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/indiatips8.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
India is changing fast but is still a traditional society. It’s best to learn about its cultures and etiquette and err on the side of caution. </p>
<p>For example, unless you’re on the beach in Goa, it’s wise to <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/what-to-wear-travel-india/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wear modest clothing in India</a>. Long, loose, and flowing are key for dressing for the climate and the culture. </p>
<p>It’s also best to be very respectful, especially with regard to the myriad religions. And be aware that genders relate differently in India, and overfriendliness can be misconstrued. Be polite, but with strangers, and especially those working in the hospitality sector, it’s usually best to dial back effusive friendliness. </p>
<h3>10. Follow the seasons</h3>
<p>Weather and the season matter in India. It’s incredibly hot almost everywhere in May and June, the monsoon season is July to August, and it’s surprisingly cold in north India in winter, December to February. Do some research and find out the <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/best-places-to-visit-in-india/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">best places to visit in India by season</a>. </p>
<p>So, when it’s cold in north India, head down to tropical Kerala or Goa and hit the beach. In the heat of summer, check out Ladakh, a high desert plateau that sometimes seems otherworldly. Note: Fall is festival season, so you can experience Durga Puja in Kolkata, Diwali in Jaipur, or the Camel Fair in Pushkar. </p>
<h3>11. Visit attractions in the morning</h3>
<p><img alt="A solo female traveler in a colorful sari posing in front of the Taj Mahal in India" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/indiatips7.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
As a rule, tourist destinations in India are not busy in the morning. Indians generally don’t start early, so if you want to go somewhere touristy or crowded, go early (also the coolest time of day). For example, if you are planning to see the <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/taj-mahal-photos-images-history-information/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Taj Mahal</a>, stay overnight in Agra and go at sunrise; when the gates open, the line will be mostly foreigners. Crowds of Indian tourists will roll up a few hours later. </p>
<p>(However, this rule does not apply to shopping. Stores, and even restaurants, tend not to open until 10 or even 11 am. Urban Indians tend to do everything late. Breakfast and lunch are late, and dinner can be very late indeed.)</p>
<h3>12. Head into the countryside</h3>
<p><img alt="A solo woman in India posing in a green field surrounded by grass and trees" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/indiatips5.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Most first-time travelers to India tend to design their itineraries around cities. They land in Delhi or Mumbai and head to places like Jaipur, Udaipur, Rishikesh, and Cochin. Make an effort to see the wilderness: the jungles, deserts, and mountains. India is home to more than 50 tiger reserves, several biodiversity hot spots (such as the Western Ghats and the Sundarbans), the world’s 20th largest desert (the Thar Desert), and the highest mountain range on earth (the Himalayas). </p>
<p>You can go trekking in the mountains, take a <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/tiger-safaris-reserves-india/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tiger safari</a>, visit one of the many national parks, camp out overnight on a sand dune in Rajasthan, or take a boat cruise on the Brahmaputra River. </p>
<p>And don’t forget the rural areas. Most Indians still live in villages. It’s really worthwhile to meander through the quaint villages of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, or Uttarakhand. </p>
<p><center>***</center></p>
<p>India is not an easy place to travel. It’s not a relaxing vacation destination. It is, though, an experience — often a life-changing experience. Start by doing research, <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/best-books-about-india/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read books about India</a>, watch movies about the country, learn about the cultures and various destinations, and get ready for a transformative travel experience. </p>
<p>Like many before you — from The Beatles to Steve Jobs to Elizabeth Gilbert — you may just fall in love with the place. As writer Rumer Godden said, “Once you have felt the dust of India, you will never be free of it.”</p>
<p><em>Mariellen Ward fell in love with India, with travel, and with travel blogging on her first trip to the country in 2005. She has spent more than seven years of the last 18 in India, and now lives there. Though Canadian by birth, Mariellen considers India to be her &#8220;soul culture.&#8221; With her travel blog, <a href="https://breathedreamgo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breathedreamgo</a>, she tries to encourage and help other female travelers to go after their dreams. And her custom tour company, <a href="https://indiaforbeginners.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">India for Beginners</a>, is dedicated to helping women travel safely and well in India.</em></p>

<strong>Last Updated</strong>: 11/15/22 | November 15th, 2022</p>
<p>Travelers can be a fickle group of people to buy gifts for. We&#8217;re constantly coming and going, we usually don&#8217;t carry a lot of stuff with us, and no two travelers are alike so finding the perfect gift for the traveler in your life can be tricky.</p>
<p>While a plane ticket is never a bad idea (I&#8217;m a window seat in case anyone is thinking of getting me one), I&#8217;ve put together this ultimate holiday gift guide for travelers as there&#8217;s a lot of great travel gear out there these days that helps people travel cheaper and better.</p>
<p>Even me, the gear-adverse traveler, likes a lot of this stuff!</p>
<p>This is stuff I actually think is super useful. No nonsense. No fluff. Just the best gifts for intrepid travelers and globetrotting nomads!</p>

<h2 id="first">Gifts Under $25</h2>
<h3>1. A Travel Lock</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2OHM1hR" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Master travel padlock" class="aligncenter" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/blue_padlocks.jpg" /></a>This simple item is one of the most important for the budget traveler. Since many hostels have lockers, backpackers need to have their own <a href="https://amzn.to/2OHM1hR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">travel lock</a> when they&#8217;re on the road. While you can usually rent them at hostels, those prices add up after a while. I never leave home without a lock because I know it will come in handy.</p>
<p><center><a class="amazonbuy" href="https://amzn.to/2OHM1hR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buy now on Amazon!</a></center><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Loop Earplugs</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3hpsGUA" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="travel ear plugs" class="aligncenter" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/loopearplugs.png" width="675" /></a>Anyone who has ever stayed in a hostel knows that a quality pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/3hpsGUA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earplugs</a> is a necessity. From chronic snorers to late-night drinkers to copulating couples in creaking bunks, hostels are known for their less-than-quiet accommodation. I suggest investing in good earplugs and not just the cheap foam ones. Not only will they help you sleep, but they&#8217;re great for bus trips and flights as well as wearing as you explore louder, more hectic cities. </p>
<p><center><a class="amazonbuy" href="https://amzn.to/3hpsGUA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buy now on Amazon!</a></center><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. DryFox Quick Dry Travel Towel</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.dryfoxco.com/shop/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="sea to summit travel towel" class="aligncenter" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/travelgear5.jpg" /></a>Unless you&#8217;re only staying at hotels or using Airbnb, you&#8217;re going to need to bring a towel when you travel. Having a lightweight, quick-drying towel makes a huge difference when you&#8217;re on the road since regular towels are too bulky and heavy (and they take a long time to dry). Get a <a href="https://www.dryfoxco.com/shop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">travel towel</a> for your next trip so you can travel light. They&#8217;re a compact, quick-drying solution that every backpacker needs. </p>

<h3>4. Travel Adapter</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2DbA7Yb" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="travel adapter" class="aligncenter" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/universal_adapter.jpg" /></a>Nothing is more tedious than arriving to a new destination only to realize you can&#8217;t charge your devices because the electrical outlets are different. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll need a <a href="https://amzn.to/2DbA7Yb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">travel adapter</a>. They&#8217;re a simple accessory. There&#8217;s a million out there but this is one I use as it covers every region of the world and comes with USB ports too. It&#8217;s cheap, easy to use, and lightweight. Everything you need in an adapter. </p>
<p><center><a class="amazonbuy" href="https://amzn.to/2DbA7Yb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buy now on Amazon!</a></center><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Scratch Travel Maps from Landmass</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2R4bkur" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="travel scratch map" class="aligncenter" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/scratch_map.jpg" /></a><a href="https://amzn.to/2R4bkur" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scratch maps</a> are a fun way to keep track of your past travels while helping you stay inspired as you plan your future trips. You simply scratch off the parts of the world you&#8217;ve been. Simple. Easy. <em>Landmass</em> is my favorite company that makes these, though there are plenty of other companies that make them now so you can find them in all sorts of sizes and colors.</p>

<h3>6. Passport Holder</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3mZQXQ0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A blue passport wallet" class="aligncenter" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2021/passportholdernew.png" /></a>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3mZQXQ0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passport holder</a> is a must-have for any avid traveler. Not only does it protect your passport from wear and tear, it makes your travels much more convenient. Most passport holders have slots for your travel credit cards as well as any cash you have, making it a safe and convenient way to keep your valuables secure while you travel. While there are tons of expensive and fancy passport holders out there, a simple one will get the job done and save you money in the process (money you can spend on more travels!).</p>

It&#8217;s a useful minimalist solution for budget travelers who travel carry-on only and an eco-friendly choice as well. Natural dry shampoos absorb the grease and oil in your hair, keeping it clean while you&#8217;re on the road — and with minimal effort too. It works for all types of hair and hair lengths as well so you don&#8217;t need to shave your head or do anything drastic either.</p>

It&#8217;s light, it&#8217;s powerful enough for regular use, and the battery life lasts a long time. While an iPad might be another potential travel choice, I find the Air much more versatile — especially with their new M2 chip. You can just do a lot more with it. When I&#8217;m on the road, this is the laptop I travel with.</p>

It has a solid battery life, a great lens, beautiful screen, and, is overall, just awesome. True, I&#8217;m an Apple fanboy so I might be biased but hey, it&#8217;s my list!</p>
<p>For a non-Apple phone with an equally awesome camera, check out the <a href="https://amzn.to/3trT6rD" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Pixel</a>. It has an excellent camera!</p>

The wireless <a href="https://amzn.to/3DHzO6i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bose QuietComfort 45</a> headphones are fan favorites and my go-to brand. They are comfortable, rechargable, and do an amazing job at removing background noise. If you&#8217;re on a budget, consider the QuietComfort 25 instead.</p>

Hauling around physical books is a pain if you&#8217;re traveling often. With a Kindle, you can pack over 1,000 books into a single device and many versions can also use apps and access the internet. It&#8217;s a wonderful gift for the avid reader.</p>

They&#8217;re incredible for photos and video no matter the climate. They&#8217;re waterproof and are perfect for both everyday city exploring as well as more extreme and adventurous activities. They&#8217;re just awesome. If the Hero 9 is too pricey, grab the 8. It&#8217;s just as good and a bit cheaper!</p>

<strong>Posted</strong>: 11/17/22 | November 17th, 2022</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/italy-travel-tips/rome/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rome</a> is a city of layers stretching back centuries. You’re never far from ruins or stunning ancient or classical architecture. One moment you’re passing a modern building, the next you’re staring at some Doric columns from the Roman Republic, a Renaissance-era palace designed by Michelangelo, or a piazza centered around a Bernini-designed Baroque fountain. </p>
<p>There are some cities — <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/new-york-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New York</a>, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/england-travel-tips/london/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London</a> — that offer so many attractions, you can’t help but to create a list to check off. And then there are others where you just want to wander and absorb the vibe and the aesthetics of it all. </p>
<p>Rome is both. </p>
<p>In some ways, it feels like a village, with its venerable, wise ambiance, and in others like a cosmopolitan city, since there are so many museums, historical landmarks, and great restaurants. </p>
<p>Obviously, it’s impossible to see everything in one visit. It&#8217;s what happens when you have a city of millions dating back three thousand years.</p>
<p>Which begs the question: What should you do when you may never come back? How do you decide what to do?</p>
<p>To help you make the most of your limited time in this iconic capital, here is the list of my top things to do in Rome:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Walking Tour</h3>
<p>I love taking walking tours. They’re a wonderful way to learn about a destination. I recommend Rome’s Ultimate Free Walking Tour or New Rome Free Tours. They cover all the highlights and can introduce you to the city on a budget. Just be sure to tip your guide at the end.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. The Colosseum</h3>
<p>Easily one of the most recognizable and jaw-dropping sights in the world, this first-century amphitheater is one of the top attractions in Rome. There were 80 entrances/exits in this super stadium: 76 for attendees/spectators, 2 for participants (i.e., gladiators), and 2 for the emperor. While that might seem like an excessive number, the Colosseum could hold a whopping 50,000 people in its day, and getting them in and out needed to be done quickly.</p>
<p>Buy your entry tickets at the nearby Palatine Hill entrance at Via San Gregorio 30, where the line is much shorter, or buy them online (your ticket grants access to Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum). </p>
<p>You can also book a tour with <a href="https://www.walksofitaly.com/rome-tours/roman-colosseum-tours?tap_a=8959-782171&#038;tap_s=37909-476f1e" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Walks of Italy</a> if you want a more in-depth experience.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. The Roman Forum</h3>
<p><img alt="Historic ruins and ancient buildings at the Roman Forum in Rome, Italy" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/romethings1.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Once the center of the known world, the Roman Forum today might just be stumps of marble and half-standing temples, but it’s one of the most haunting sites in town. You have to use your imagination a bit, but this swath of dirt and marble was once bustling, lined with shops, open-air markets, and temples. </p>
<p>The Via Sacra is the main street that cuts through the Forum, the place where all roads in the empire either began or ended. Once the empire fell, the Forum became a pasture for farm animals; it was known in the Middle Ages as Campo Vaccino, or Cow Field. Over the centuries, much of the marble was plundered, and the area was eventually buried as the center point of Rome shifted. It wasn’t until the 19th century that archeologists began excavating and rediscovering the Forum. </p>
<p><em>Via della Salara Vecchia, +39 06-3996-7700, parcocolosseo.it. Open daily 9am–sunset. Admission is 16 EUR. The ticket gets visitors into the Colosseum and Palatine Hill. </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Explore the Vatican Museums</h3>
<p>Home to the famous Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Museums house four miles of rooms and hallways bedecked with one of the world’s great art collections. In addition to the Michelangelo masterpiece on the chapel’s ceiling, there are rooms frescoed by Raphael and paintings by Da Vinci, Titian, Caravaggio, and Fra Angelico, among others, plus halls and halls of ancient Greek and Roman statuary, Egyptian mummies, and Etruscan relics. </p>
<p>TIP: Don’t join the mile-long line in the morning like everyone else. Instead, go after lunch, when you can practically walk right in without waiting at all. </p>

<p><em>Viale del Vaticano, +39 06 6988-4676, museivaticani.va. Open Monday–Saturday 9am–6pm. Admission is 18 EUR.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. St. Peter’s Square and St. Peter’s Basilica</h3>
<p>The grandest of church in the Catholic world, St. Peter’s was designed by a veritable Renaissance and Baroque dream team: Bernini took care of the two column-filled arms that surround the square, Bramante created an early design for the basilica, and Michelangelo put the dome on top. One hundred and twenty years after construction began, the church was finally consecrated in 1626. It sits on the spot where a fourth-century church once sat and on top of the spot where St. Peter himself was crucified. His bones are still below, where there is an ancient necropolis. </p>
<p>Inside the basilica you’ll find soaring domes featuring angels and cherubs blissfully floating around a partly cloudy sky, as well as plus-sized marble sculptures of saints, popes, and Biblical figures. For 8 EUR, you can climb the 551 steps to the top of Michelangelo’s dome. For 2 EUR more, you can take an elevator. </p>
<p><em>Piazza San Pietro, +39 06 6982 3731, vatican.va. Open daily 7am–7pm. Admission is free. </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Campo de’ Fiori</h3>
<p>One of the most organic-feeling squares in Rome, this central space — whose name means “field of flowers&#8221; — is home to the historic center’s morning fruit and veggie market. The sculpture on a pedestal in the center of the square is that of Giordano Bruno, who was burned here after he got on the pope’s bad side for criticizing the Church. The sculpture was erected in the late 19th century, when the state of Italy and the Catholic Church were at odds with each other. It’s no coincidence that the somber face of the sculpture is looking in the direction of the Vatican.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>7. Visit Santa Maria del Popolo</h3>
<p>This church on one of Rome’s prettiest squares is said to be located on the spot where Emperor Nero was buried. A millennium after his death, there were still tales of ghosts and ghouls who haunted the place, so the pope had a church built there in order to quell the haunting. It worked. </p>
<p>Parts of the church have been redesigned through the centuries, including the apse by Bramante and frescoes in some of the chapels by Pinturicchio. But the real draw is the two jaw-droppingly gorgeous Caravaggio paintings on display in the chapel, just to the left of the altar. Most people come for these, but the Chigi chapel was designed by Raphael and completed by Bernini, so don’t miss that, either. </p>
<p><em>Piazza del Popolo 12, +39 06 361 0836. Open daily 7am–1pm and 4pm–7pm. Admission is free. </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. See Piazza Navona</h3>
<p><img alt="A beautiful fountain by Bernini in the Piazza Navona in Rome, Italy" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/romethings2.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Rome’s most popular piazza began as an ancient Roman circus (as its oval shape will testify), where horse racing and other sporting events took place. Today, the main sport is sitting at an outdoor café and nursing a beverage while gawking at tourists and locals alike. Don’t miss Bernini’s best fountain in the center of the square, Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers). It’s pure drama set in stone.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. Explore Testaccio</h3>
<p>Located south of the vast city center, Testaccio is an erstwhile working-class neighborhood. Younger Romans might associate it with nightlife and clubbing, as there have long been a number of clubs hugging up against Monte Testaccio, the historic mound that the neighborhood is centered around. </p>
<p>Older Romans will associate the neighborhood with food because, in the 19th century, it was home to the city’s main slaughterhouse. As part of their pay, workers at the slaughterhouse would receive a bag of raw meat to take home, also known as the “fifth quarter” — the tail, intestines, and stomach, among other parts. Sometimes instead of going home, workers would take their “fifth quarter” to a local restaurant and have it cooked for them there. As a result, this became the de facto local cuisine, and the district was where some of Rome’s most famous dishes were born.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>10. Villa Borghese and Borghese Gardens</h3>
<p>At 60 hectares (148 acres), the Villa Borghese property — a swath of verdant grass dotted with umbrella pines northeast of the historic center — makes up Rome’s second largest parkland. In ancient times, the area was known as the Garden of Lucullus, before becoming a vast vineyard. But in 1605, Cardinal Scipione Borghese — nephew of Pope Paul V and patron to sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini — converted the land into a park. The 19th century saw a redesign, with the green space getting a more manicured, English accent. </p>
<p>The property is sprinkled with temples and monuments, all of which had been given a serious sprucing up for the 1911 World Exposition, and its balustrade offers one of the best views of Rome. The park is centered, however, around the Galleria Borghese, which houses one of the city’s greatest art collections (including works by Bernini, Raphael, Titian, and Caravaggio). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/rome-l33/borghese-gallery-tour-with-gardens-t390350/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&#038;utm_medium=online_publisher&#038;placement=content-middle" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skip the line tickets</a> (that include a guide) are just 50 EUR.</p>
<p><em>Piazzale del Museo Borghese 5, +39 06 841-3979, galleriaborghese.beniculturali.it. Open daily 9am–7pm. Reservations are necessary for the Galleria (admission is 13 EUR), but the park is always free. </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>11. Admire Santa Maria della Concezione (I Cappuccini)</h3>
<p>Sandwiched between the posh thoroughfare Via Veneto and car-snarled Piazza Barberini, this church is a relatively ordinary 17th-century structure. There is a dramatic altarpiece in a chapel of St. Michael the Archangel by Baroque painter Guido Reni, but that’s not necessarily why you should make it a priority to get here. </p>
<p>The reason is in the crypt, accessible from the street-level side of the church. Commonly just called I Capuccini, it is one of the most macabre sights in all of Europe: the bones of 4,000 friars, many of them still in full skeletal form (and many still wearing their brown habits), grace the walls of the long, narrow room with five chapels. Other bones were used to create ornamental objects: shinbone chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and pelvic bones are arranged to make an ersatz hourglass. In the last chapel, a plaque offers a sober — if somewhat appropriate — reminder: “What you are now, we once were; what we are now, you shall be.” </p>
<p><em>Via Veneto 27, cappucciniviaveneto.it. Open daily 10am–7pm. Admission is 8.50 EUR. </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>12.	The Spanish Steps</h3>
<p><img alt="The famous Spanish Steps on a quiet, sunny day in Rome, Italy" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/romethings3.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
The world’s most famous set of steps were completed in 1725 for the purpose of easing church-goers’ ascension up the then muddy hill to the church of Trinità dei Monti. The bottom of the stairs features a modest fountain by Bernini. The name comes from the fact that the Spanish embassy has long been on the square where the stairs spill out. </p>
<p>A recent law makes it forbidden to sit on the steps, so the time-honored tradition of eating gelato while lounging on the steps is now just a memory. But it’s worth strolling up the stairs nonetheless.<br />

<h3>13. Trevi Fountain</h3>
<p>More a theater of waterworks than a fountain, the iconic Trevi Fountain is best viewed in the early morning or late at night, when the area is devoid of the miasma of picture-taking tourists. Every year, at least one crazy tourist — usually under the influence of Italian wine or other substances — decides it would be a good idea to go for a swim. </p>
<p>Fun fact: the coins that people toss in the fountain (totaling thousands of euros each day) are given to the Red Cross.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>14. Ara Pacis</h3>
<p>The Ara Pacis — or Altar of Augustan Peace — is an ornate marble altar made in the decade before Christ’s birth. It was commissioned to celebrate the Pax Augusta, the empire-wide peace that existed under the rule of Emperor Augustus. Specifically, it was made to celebrate the emperor’s own conquest north of the Alps in the year 13 BCE. The four walls of the altar show scenes of Roman mythology. Be sure to have a look at the interesting depiction of a pig slaughtering on the west wall — a common practice when Romans made a peace treaty. </p>
<p>The altar was an obsession of Mussolini, who was determined to be thought of as the next Augustus. The Ara Pacis, facing the tomb of Augustus where Mussolini hoped to be interned one day, is surrounded on three sides by Fascist-era buildings. Il Duce wanted to turn the area around the altar into a “Fascist theme park.” Fortunately, he didn’t succeed. </p>
<p>The stark white structure that now houses the Ara Pacis was designed in 2006 by American architect Richard Meier. It was the first civic building constructed in Rome’s historic center since World War II and is a favorite target for conservative politicians, who regularly threaten to destroy it. </p>
<p><em>Lungotevere in Augusta, +39 06-060-608, arapacis.it. Open daily 9:30am–7:30pm. Admission is 13 EUR.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>15. San Pietro in Vincoli</h3>
<p>Tucked away in the central, but untrammeled, Monti district that’s wedged between the Roman Forum and Termini railway station, this ancient place of worship doesn’t look like much from its simple arcaded façade. But those who venture inside are rewarded. The interior of this fifth-century church, its nave flanked by Doric columns, is home to one of Christianity’s most esteemed relics: the chains that once held Saint Peter (hence the church’s name: Saint Peter in Chains), hanging in view underneath the altar. </p>
<p>And while it’s a place of pilgrimage for the devout, art aficionados are lured here for another reason: Michelangelo’s magnificent sculpture of Moses. The sculpture of the bearded Biblical figure was actually meant to be part of the monumental 47-statue tomb of Pope Julius II that he had hoped would be his final resting place. But plans were scrapped — the project’s pomp and audacity came under serious fire — and all that we’re left with today are Moses and a few unfinished (but graceful and quasi-erotic-looking) slave sculptures.</p>
<p><em>Piazza S. Pietro in Vincoli 4a, +39 06 488-2865, lateranensi.org/sanpietroinvincoli. Open daily 8am–12:30pm and 3pm–6pm. Admission is free.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>16. The Baths of Caracalla</h3>
<p>Named after Roman Emperor Caracalla, who had the baths constructed in 217 CE, this massive bath complex was more than just a place to relax by the pool. In ancient Roman society, baths were an institution. In fact, they dotted the city in the same way gyms are sprinkled through modern cities. </p>
<p>The Baths of Caracalla, however, were the grandest of them all. It could accommodate up to 1,500 bathers at a time, who would usually undergo the entire process: a Turkish bath followed by a few minutes in the calidarium (similar to a sauna), then the tepidarium (a pool of lukewarm water), which was followed by a dip in the freezing frigidarium and, at last, the natatio, a huge, open-air swimming pool where Roman men would congregate to gossip and talk politics. The baths lasted some 300 years before invading Goths destroyed the plumbing, causing a fatal hemorrhage of water. </p>
<p><em>Viale delle Terme di Caracalla 52, +39 06 3996 7700, soprintendenzaspecialeroma.it. Open Tuesday–Sunday 9am–7pm. Admission is 10 EUR.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>17. The Pantheon</h3>
<p><img alt="The exterior of the ancient Pantheon in Rome, Italy" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/romethings4.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Built around 125 CE, this “temple to all gods” is one of the most majestic buildings still standing from antiquity and an absolute must-see any time of day (though morning is the least crowded). The then-revolutionary rotunda design became the blueprint for buildings for centuries after. Today the Pantheon is the final resting place for some of Italy’s most famous citizens, including the artist Raphael, King Vittorio Emanuele II, King Umberto I, and Queen Margherita of Savoy. </p>
<p>The building used to have a dynamic copper roof. That is, until artist Bernini five-fingered the copper for his 95-foot tall canopy in the just-built St. Peter’s Basilica. You can <a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/pantheon-rome-l2897/rome-35-minute-pantheon-audio-guide-tour-t122912/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&#038;utm_medium=online_publisher&#038;placement=content-end" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">purchase an audio guide</a> for 8.50 EUR.</p>
<p><em>Piazza della Rotunda, +39 347 82 05 204, pantheonroma.com. Open daily 9am–7pm. Admission is free. </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>18. Santa Maria sopra Minvera</h3>
<p>During the Middle Ages, Rome was in serious decline: at one point, the population had fallen to just 20,000. Even the popes didn’t want to be there (many escaped to Viterbo, 80 miles north of the Eternal City, and even Avignon in the south of France). There wasn’t much construction going on for a few centuries, which is why Santa Maria sopra Minerva, located a cobblestone’s throw from the Pantheon, is the only Gothic church in town. </p>
<p>The church actually takes its names from the temple of the pagan god Minerva that it’s built over. Inside, admire the starry-skied ceiling, but don’t miss the Michelangelo sculpture of Christ holding up the cross. There’s also a “Madonna and Child” painted by Renaissance master Fra Angelico. </p>
<p>In the piazza in front of the church is one of the most unique sculptures in the history of art: an Egyptian obelisk plopped on top of a sculpture of an elephant. Bernini found the obelisk in the garden of the church’s monastery, and the monks suggested putting it in the middle of the square in front of the church. Bernini, being an artistic genius with a fine sense of humor, carved an elephant — a symbol of piety and intelligence — and affixed the obelisk to the top. It was originally meant as a joke, but it’s remained there ever since. </p>
<p><em>Piazza della Minerva 42, +39 06-679-3926, santamariasopraminerva.it. Open daily 11am–3pm and 5pm–7pm. Admission is free.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>19. The Appian Way (Appia Antica)</h3>
<p>The Roman road system was one of the marvels of the ancient world. And the Appian Way — or, as the locals call it, the Appia Antica — was once a superhighway, stretching from the capital all the way to the “heel” of the boot (to the town of Brindisi). The section of “the Queen of Roads,” as it’s nicknamed, that lies just outside of Rome is now a 6,000-acre public park and one of the best off-of-the-radar sites of the Eternal City. </p>
<p>The road begins at the third-century CE Aurelian Walls and the Gate of San Sebastian and then is quickly met with ancient Christian catacombs. Soon the brick-sized cobblestones give way to large, irregularly shaped, pizza-sized basalt stones, complete with ruts made from centuries of Roman chariots moving up and down the road. Crumbling, millennia-old mausoleums and shady umbrella pines flank the road, which is completely traffic free on Sundays. Remnants of mosaic-floored villas and stadiums line the road and make for a perfect excuse for a breather. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>20. San Giovanni in Laterano</h3>
<p>This gigantic barn of a church is one of the most important in the Catholic world. The ornate Baroque and Rococo façade belies its age, although it’s the oldest among the four major basilicas of Rome (St. Peter’s, Santa Maria Maggiore, and St. Paul’s Outside the Walls being the other three). The entire complex, which also consists of a palace just across the square (today split by a busy street), was the original home base of the pope; until 1870 all popes were crowned here. Today, the church is still the official ecclesiastical seat of the Bishop of Rome (who happens to be the pope). </p>
<p>The basilica was completely renovated in the 18th century and given a full flourish of ornate Baroque design. Alessandro Galilei won the competition to reconstruct the exterior (giving the façade a more palace-like look), and Francesco Borromini was given the job to redesign the interior. He left the central Gothic Baldacchino (canopy) over the altar, which today appears wildly out of place. </p>
<p><em>Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano 4. Open daily 7am–6:30pm. Admission is free. </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>21. Trastevere</h3>
<p>Literally meaning “across the Tiber,” Trastevere is Rome’s most enchanting, achingly charming neighborhood (and <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/where-to-stay-rome/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my favorite area to stay in</a> when I&#8217;m visiting the city). The narrow winding streets are lined with atmospheric cafés and bars so grab a table on a cobbled lane, order a glass of wine or a beer, and enjoy the people-watching.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>22. Santa Croce in Gerusalemme</h3>
<p>The floor of this legendary basilica, located on the periphery of Rome’s historic center, may look like a normal, tiled floor now, but when the church was first consecrated in 325 CE, it was covered in soil. But this was no ordinary dirt. It was brought from Jerusalem. Which is fitting, since this magnificent, off-the-tourist-radar basilica was built to hold the supposed True Cross. </p>
<p>It was founded by the aforementioned St. Helena, the mother of the first Christian emperor (Constantine) and one of the Catholic Church’s first relics fanatics. She traveled to the Holy Land in search of the cross Jesus was crucified on. And when she returned home, she had a lot more than just a chunk of the True Cross. Today, the objects from her travels in the Holy Land are on display in a Fascist-era chapel in a back room of the church: thorns from Christ’s cross, a pole he was flagellated on, and a finger from St. Thomas (the same one he allegedly stuck in Christ’s side). </p>
<p>Though the church is 1,700 years old, it got the Baroque treatment in the mid-18th century, which is responsible for the structure’s present appearance. </p>
<p><em>Piazza Santa Croce in Gerusalemme 12, +39 06 701 4769, santacroceroma.it/en. Open Monday–Saturday 7am–12.45pm and 3.30–7:30pm. Admission is free.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>23. Castel Sant’Angelo</h3>
<p><img alt="The towering Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, Italy" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/romethings5.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
This giant stone structure on the banks of the Tiber began life as a monolithic mausoleum for Emperor Hadrian in the second century CE. In the Middle Ages, it served as a fortress for the pope, who would lock himself inside when the city was under attack. Now that the pope doesn’t have to worry as much about sieges by barbarians, Castel Sant’Angelo is a great place to wander. The gently sloping circular ramps shuttle visitors to the roof, which affords a fantastic view of Rome and the Vatican. </p>
<p><em>Lungotevere Castello 50, +39 06 681 9111. Open daily 9am–7:30pm. <a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/castel-sant-angelo-l2902/rome-castel-sant-angelo-skip-the-line-entry-ticket-t415831/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&#038;utm_medium=online_publisher&#038;placement=content-middle" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Skip-the-line tickets</a> are 22 EUR.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>24. Santa Maria della Vittoria</h3>
<p>This unassuming Baroque church, a short distance from the historic center, is a must-see sight for art lovers. In the fourth chapel on the left is Bernini’s massive sculpture, The Ecstasy of St. Teresa, which shows the Spanish mystic laying on a cloud and, in a near orgasmic trance, being pierced by the hot arrow of an angel. </p>
<p>If you think the subject is a little ambiguous, you’d be right. The work of art is the closest one could come to the sculptural theater without making the subjects move. Try to see the angel from as many angles as possible: from one, it looks like the angel has a tender smile; from another, that same smile looks like one of anger. </p>
<p>When St. Teresa had her heavenly encounter, she wrote: “So intense was the pain, I uttered several moans; so great was the sweetness caused by the pain that I never wanted to lose it.” </p>
<p><em>Via Venti Settembre 17, +39 06 4274 0571. Open daily 9am–noon and 3:30pm–6pm. Admission is free.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/italy-travel-tips/rome/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rome</a> is a massive city brimming with historic sites and amazing food.

You can book your hostel with <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hostelworld</a>.

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget Travel Insurance</strong><br />
Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It&#8217;s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I&#8217;ve had to use it many times in the past. My favorite companies that offer the best service and value are:</p>

                for many travelers because it was perceived as being dangerous. But things have changed in CDMX (short

<strong>Posted</strong>: 11/28/2022 | November 28th, 2022</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/mexico-travel-tips/mexico-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico City</a> used to be off the radar for many travelers because it was perceived as being dangerous. But things have changed in CDMX (short for Ciudad de México) and today it’s one of the most popular places to visit in the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/mexico-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I loved my time in Mexico City</a>. It’s an incredible foodie destination, has a fun nightlife, lots of history, green space, and boasts lots of galleries and museums to explore. (The art and literature scene here is one of the best in the world.)</p>
<p>It’s also a huge, sprawling metropolis, so choosing the right neighborhood to stay in — one that aligns with your interests and travel style — is important. Traffic can be slow, so you don’t want to waste your visit stuck in transit — or risk your safety by staying in the wrong neighborhood.</p>
<p>To help you decide where to stay in Mexico City, here is my breakdown of the best neighborhoods for visitors (as well as suggested accommodations in each).</p>
<p>But, before I get to that, here are some frequent questions I get asked about staying in Mexico City:</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for foodies? </strong><br />
Though the entire city is a foodie paradise, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#one">Condesa and Roma Norte</a> are two adjacent districts that have excellent food markets, street food, and restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for families? </strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#two">Coyoacán</a> is pretty far from the center, but that’s what makes it perfect for families: there’s a subway connection and the area is tranquil and safe. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for partying?</strong><br />
You can find a party anywhere you go but Condesa and Roma Norte are still two of the best for tourists. Zona Rosa and Jaurez also have a lot of bars and a bustling nightlife.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for history lovers? </strong><br />
Mexico City’s <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#four">Centro Histórico</a> is crammed with interesting historical sites and is pretty much unavoidable anyway, since it’s the most centrally located neighborhood. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for shopping?</strong><br />
Upscale and sophisticated, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#five">Polanco</a> is bursting with high-end boutiques and outposts of famous fashion designers. If you want to shop ’til you drop (and perhaps max out your credit card), this is the place to do it. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood overall? </strong><br />
For me, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#one">Roma Norte</a> is the best neighborhood to stay in. It&#8217;s beautiful, has lots of green space, safe, centrally located, and has a lot of the top restaurants in the city. It&#8217;s the hip place to be.</p>
<p>With those questions answered, here is my detailed breakdown of each neighborhood!</p>

<h3 id="one">Where to Stay in Mexico City for Overal: Roma Norte or Condesa</a></h3>

Roma Norte and Condesa sit next to each other and are referred to as “sister neighborhoods.” They’re both super leafy and safe, the streets are lined with world-class restaurants, awesome taco stalls, hip coffee shops, craft cocktail bars, and big food markets. This is the hip, artisty area of the city and it&#8217;s one of my absolute favorites. (It&#8217;s also the most &#8220;foreign&#8221; as most visitors and expats stay here so you&#8217;ll see more Gringos here than anywhere else in the city.)</p>
<p><strong>Best Places to Stay in Condesa and Roma</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BUDGET</strong>: <a href="https://hostelworld.prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHostel-Home%2FMexico-City%2F883" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hostel Home</a> — Located in Roma, Mexico City’s first hostel offers fast and free Wi-Fi, comfortable beds, and complimentary bottled water.

Coyoacán, located about 35 minutes by the metro from the Zócalo (main square), in the southern part of the city, is one of the prettiest neighborhoods in Mexico City. The cobblestone streets and colonial-era houses give the district a charming vibe. It’s quiet and safe here as well. And the central park in the neighborhood, Jardín Centenario, is a great place to hang out and people-watch. Coyoacán is also home to the Frida Kahlo Museum and a bunch of incredible food and clothing markets. It&#8217;s a really good place to stay if you want to be away from big crowds.</p>

The Centro Histórico is home to all the must see historical sites like the Zócalo, the Metropolitan Cathedral, National Palace (and the Diego Rivera murals inside it), Palacio de Bellas Artes cultural center, and the Torre Latinoamericana skyscraper. If you plan to do a lot of sightseeing, staying here for at least part of your visit is worth considering.</p>

This posh district is known as the “Beverly Hills of Mexico” and is home to Pujol, perhaps the best restaurant in the country, as well as the upscale restaurants Mr. Chow, Morimoto, Nobu, and the Basque/molecular eatery Biko. It’s also where you’ll find the densest collection of luxury shopping in the country (the Antara fashion Hall, a high-end shopping center, is located here).

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Posted: 12/1/2022 &amp;#124; December 1st, 2022 Tulum, located in the southern section
                of Quintana Roo on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, used to be a sleepy beach town that attracted hippie

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="The famous beaches of Tulum, Mexico with Mayan ruins looming on the cliff above" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/tulumsafe.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
<strong>Posted</strong>: 12/1/2022 | December 1st, 2022</p>
<p>Tulum, located in the southern section of Quintana Roo on Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, used to be a sleepy beach town that attracted hippie types who preferred the placid beaches and its <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/the-mayan-ruins-of-tulum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mayan ruins</a> over Cancún’s wild, cacophonous nightlife. </p>
<p>In the last decade or so, though, the hippies have been overtaken by influencers, boho-chic digital nomads, and would-be yogis. So, while I enjoyed seeing the ruins there, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/tulum-sucks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I’m not a big fan of Tulum these days</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s just me. Hundreds of thousands of people visit each year and love their time there. Travel is subjective, after all.</p>
<p>Home to some of the best-preserved Mayan ruins and picturesque white-sand beaches, Tulum is definitely a gorgeous slice of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/mexico-travel-tips/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mexico</a>. </p>
<p>But is Tulum safe? </p>
<p>That depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>The Overseas Security Advisory Council says that Tulum is &#8220;<a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/6f145a09-c598-4540-b730-198426dcda51" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moderately safe</a>&#8221; — though there was at least one kidnapping of a tourist there earlier this year, and two women were killed by gang crossfire while dining at a restaurant in 2021. </p>
<p>For the state of Quintana Roo, which includes Tulum, the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mexico-travel-advisory.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">information from the US State Department</a> says to &#8220;exercise increased caution&#8221; when traveling there (as opposed to six other states in Mexico, where the report said, “Do not travel to”). </p>
<p>That said, I’ve visited Tulum a few times now — and have road-tripped around the region — and never felt unsafe. Sure, you need to keep your wits about you and keep an eye out for petty theft, but that’s what you should do anywhere you travel.</p>
<p>To help you understand more about the city and decide if you feel comfortable visiting, here is everything you need to know to stay safe in Tulum. </p>

<h3 id="one">Is Tulum Safe for Solo Travelers?</a></h3>
<p>Generally, yes. It’s in the local and national governments’ interest to make an effort to keep tourist-heavy destinations like Tulum safe. If tourists start getting robbed (or worse) in Tulum, visitors will stop coming, local businesses will suffer, and, as a result, there would then probably be more crime. It’s cyclical. </p>
<p>If you exercise some caution, as you should do in any new destination, you’ll likely avoid any serious issues.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="two">Is Tulum Safe for Solo Female Travelers? </a></h3>
<p>Tulum is generally safe for solo female travelers. That said, female travelers have additional concerns and should exercise even more caution. Don’t walk alone at night, for example, while in Tulum. Never accept a drink from someone unless you saw it being poured or made. And always keep an eye on your drink when out at the bar.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="three">Are Taxis in Tulum Safe?</a></h3>
<p>Taxi drivers have a pretty bad reputation no matter where you are in the world. I’m happy to report that that reputation does not extend to this seaside town. Just be sure to agree on a price before you depart. </p>
<p>Taxis are plentiful in Tulum so in most cases you should not have a problem finding one. If in doubt, though, have your hotel or hostel call one for you so you can be sure you get a reputable driver.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="four">Is Renting a Car in Tulum Safe? </a></h3>
<p>There are some rental car scams that travelers should be aware of — not just in Tulum but anywhere in Mexico. It’s quite common, for example, to rent a car online and then show up at the office only to be told that they don’t have any cars at the moment. </p>
<p>The other issue is with hidden fees. There are exorbitant costs for insurance that you’re only told about at the last minute, so be aware when you book that you might get the deal that you think you’re getting.</p>
<p>Aside from these issues, it’s safe to rent a car in Tulum. </p>

&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="five">Is There an Issue with Gangs and Drug Cartels in Tulum? </a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, crime has increased in Tulum, and the majority of it is drug-related gang activity. <a href="https://www.reforma.com/aplicacioneslibre/preacceso/articulo/default.aspx?__rval=1&#038;urlredirect=https://www.reforma.com/aplicaciones/articulo/default.aspx?id=2138575" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Since 2019, drug-related gang crimes have increased by a whopping 783%</a>. The good news is that this is mostly gang-on-gang violence and not aimed at tourists. </p>
<p>The key here is this: don’t use or buy drugs while in Mexico in general, and Tulum in particular. You’re just inviting danger.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="six">Can You Drink the Tap Water in Tulum?</a></h3>
<p>The tap water all over Mexico — not just in Tulum — is notorious for not being as clean as it could be. That goes for ice cubes too. Find out first if the water in restaurants is filtered and then ask if the ice cubes are too. </p>
<p>Tulum can sometimes be sweltering, and sipping iced drinks might be refreshing, but it would be even worse to be stuck in your hotel room with stomach issues because you drank tap water or an iced drink that was contaminated with tap water.</p>
<p>Bottled water isn’t the most eco-friendly thing, but when in Tulum, stick to it, just to be safe. You can also bring a <a href="https://lifestraw.xyibsh.net/mgXd1D" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LifeStraw bottle</a>, which has a built-in filter to ensure that your water is always clean and safe to drink.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="seven">Can I Walk Around at Night in Tulum?</a></h3>
<p>It’s not recommended — especially if you’re alone. Making things more complicated, the beach hotels and the center of town are not necessarily a quick jaunt from each other on foot, so you should take a taxi. The good news is that taxis are abundant in Tulum. </p>
<p>So, unless it’s a super short distance, don’t walk at night in Tulum.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="eight">10 Safety Tips for Tulum</a></h3>
<p>Tulum is one of the more reliably safe spots in Mexico. That said, you should still exercise caution, particularly when you leave the heavily touristed areas of town. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<p><strong>1. Stay alert</strong> – When walking around, especially at night, stay very alert and mindful of your surroundings. Do your best to fit in.</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep your phone out of the reach of others</strong> – Pickpockets love to prey on careless tourists, so keep your phone out of the reach of others at all times. If you walk around swinging your smartphone all over the place, you might find that item suddenly missing.</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep your valuables at home</strong> – Similarly, if you have a lot of nice jewelry and/or an expensive watch, keep it at home or in the hotel room safe. You don’t want to attract the wrong kind of attention.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be cautious at night if you’re traveling alone</strong> – Tulum isn’t the most dangerous place at night, but in some places, it’s not as well lit as it should be. Don’t walk around alone late at night if you can avoid it — especially between the center of town and the beachfront hotel zone. </p>
<p><strong>5. Download an offline map</strong> – If you don’t have international roaming, download an offline map to use for navigation. Just be sure not to pull your smartphone out too much, lest it get stolen.</p>
<p><strong>6. Learn some Spanish</strong> – Uttering a few words of the local language is always a good thing. It can open doors and help you fit in (and you’re less likely to be a target). It’s also useful in case of an emergency. The emergency number in Mexico is 911.</p>
<p><strong>7. Be mindful of your money</strong> – Don’t carry every peso you have in your wallet or pocket. Spread it around (some in your wallet, some in the hotel safe, some in your backpack), so that if someone steals your wallet or robs you, you will still have money secured elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>8. Download the Prey app to your phone and laptop</strong> – If your phone or your laptop gets stolen, the <a href="https://preyproject.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prey app</a> allows you to track where it is. You can install the app for free and then upgrade to a paid version (it’s just $5 USD) if you need to track your stolen device. Prey can also activate your phone’s camera and take a photo of the thief.</p>
<p><strong>9. Be careful when using ATMs</strong> – Only use ATMs inside a bank. Not only can skimmers be placed on outdoor ATMs (to steal your PIN), but robberies are much more common at them. To stay safe, only use indoor ATMs.</p>
<p><strong>10. Watch out for riptides</strong> – While the beaches in Tulum are stunning, the riptides can be dangerous. Never stray too far from shore, just to be safe. If you’re not a strong swimmer, stick to the pool.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="nine">So, Should You Visit Tulum?</a></h3>
<p>In terms of safety, yes. As I said above, there has been a fair share of drug- and gang-related crime in Tulum over the last few years, but if you’re not seeking out drugs — and you really shouldn’t be — then likely you’ll avoid experiencing any such issues.<br />
 &nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="ten">My Most Important Advice</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-travel-insurance-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Buy travel insurance</a>. We never think that something is going to go wrong on trips. But it does sometimes — which I’ve learned from experience. I’ve lost luggage in South Africa, had my gear break in Italy, and popped an eardrum in Thailand. I was also knifed in Colombia.</p>
<p>While it’s not fun to think about, bad things can happen while you’re traveling.</p>
<p>That’s why I never leave home without travel insurance. You shouldn’t either — especially if you’re heading to Mexico. For just a couple of bucks a day, you’ll get a safety net that ensures that you won’t go bankrupt should something bad and unexpected happen.</p>
<p>Don’t cheap out on your health and safety. It’s not worth the risk.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-insurance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here’s everything you need to know about picking a comprehensive insurance plan</a>. </p>
<p><center>***</center></p>
<p>Tulum has quickly become the epicenter of the so-called Riviera Maya, attracting all types of people who gravitate here for its stunning white-sand beaches hugging up along blue-green waters, as well as the nicely preserved Mayan ruins. </p>
<p>While it’s a generally safe place for tourists, you should always be alert and exercise caution while you’re in Tulum. Do that, and you’ll be able to have a fun — and safe — visit.</p>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Posted: 12/15/22 &amp;#124; December 15th, 2022 Dublin is a city with soul. While the
                capital of the Republic of Ireland might not have the aesthetics of Prague or Amsterdam, and while it
                might not have the in-vogue vibe of Paris or the hustle and bustle of London, it has something that many

<strong>Posted</strong>: 12/15/22 | December 15th, 2022</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/ireland/dublin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dublin</a> is a city with soul. While the capital of the Republic of Ireland might not have the aesthetics of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/czech-republic-travel-tips/prague/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prague</a> or <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/the-netherlands-travel-tips/amsterdam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a>, and while it might not have the in-vogue vibe of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/france-travel-tips/paris/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paris</a> or the hustle and bustle of <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/england-travel-tips/london/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London</a>, it has something that many other European cities lack: soul, ambience, and heart. </p>
<p>There are certainly many historical landmarks and attractions to visit in Dublin: Trinity College, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Grafton Street, and the Guinness Brewery, among others. But the real attraction is its warm and welcoming people. </p>
<p>And where to find those friendly Irish folk? In a pub, of course. </p>
<p>Dublin’s true heart and soul lies in its many atmospheric pubs. I’m not advocating you spend your days and nights getting sloshed, but pubs there are the equivalent of the neighborhood osteria or trattoria in Rome or the sidewalk café in Paris or the beer garden in Munich. It&#8217;s where you’ll experience the true heart of the city. </p>
<p>Home to over 25% of the country’s population, Dublin is dissected by the River Liffey, creating two very distinct parts of town. A common first question that Dubliners ask one another (if they haven’t picked up the accent first) is: Northside or Southside? </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, it’s important to pick the right neighborhood while staying in Dublin, since that will impact your entire trip.</p>
<p>To help you decide where to stay in Dublin, I’ll highlight the best neighborhoods, so you can choose the area that best suits your travel style and budget.</p>
<p>But before I get to the specifics, here are some common questions I get asked about Dublin neighborhoods: </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for food lovers? </strong><br />
If you let your stomach guide you when you travel, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#one">Portobello</a> should be on your radar. Located on the Southside, it boasts the city’s most diverse dining scene. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for families? </strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#two">The Docklands</a>, offers a mix of old and new. It&#8217;s also just a short jaunt to Merrion Square, which is home to a lovely park and several museums. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for partying? </strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#three">Temple Bar</a> is a fitting name for this river-hugging neighborhood on the city’s Southside. The streets of this compact district are overflowing with pubs. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for hipsters? </strong><br />
Located on the Southside and hugging up against Portobello, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#four">The Liberties</a> is one of a few up-and-coming neighborhoods in Dublin. If you fancy hanging out with mustached young men, kale-smoothie-swilling locals, and third-wave-coffee-brewing folk, The Liberties is the place for you. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood for feeling like a local?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#five">Stoneybatter</a>, located on the Northside along the river, is not really on the tourist radar but is smack in the center of things at the same time. There are some great neighborhood pubs here, such as the Cobblestone, and excellent gastropubs, such as L. Mulligan Grocer. </p>
<p><strong>What’s the best neighborhood overall?</strong><br />
The neighborhood that incorporates a handful of important historical sites and attractions, as well as great pubs, cool haunts, and excellent eateries is <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/#four">The Liberties</a>, making it the best neighborhood in Dublin, overall. </p>
<p>So, with those questions answered, here’s a breakdown of each neighborhood, with suggested accommodations, so you know exactly where to stay in Dublin:</p>

<h3 id="one">Where to Stay in Dublin for Foodies: Portobello</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Old houses lining the River Liffey in the Portobello district of Dublin, Ireland" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/dublinstay1.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Located on the Southside of Dublin, Portobello is the birthplace of writer George Bernard Shaw and is closely associated with the drinking habits of James Joyce. These days, it happens to be one of Dublin’s best neighborhoods for people who like food. </p>
<p>Portobello’s roads are lined with excellent eateries, from Michelin-recommended restaurants to salt-of-the-earth spots to bustling brunch cafés. It’s all here. Come with an empty stomach, and you’ll leave very full. </p>
<p>Portobello is a small swath of the Southside, and accommodations within the boundaries of the neighborhood are hard to come by. But there are several options right on the border of the district. </p>
<p><strong>Best Places to Stay in Portobello</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><img alt="A view over the canal in the Docklands neighborhood of Dublin, Ireland on a sunny summer day" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/docklands1.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
The Docklands are set along both sides of the river and offer a mix of old and new. Here you&#8217;ll find plenty to see and do for the whole family, including setting foot on the replica famine ship The Jeanie Johnston (over 2 million people fled Ireland during the famine between 1845-55). You can also get out on the water and go paddleboarding or kayaking, and there&#8217;s even an escape room on a boat here too.</p>
<p>Nearby, you&#8217;ll find Merrion Square, which is awash in museums. The National Gallery, the National Museum, and the National History Museum are all here. Plus, there are plenty of family-friendly diversions in Merrion Square itself, including a large, active playground. </p>

There once was a time — several decades ago, actually — when Temple Bar was a decrepit no-go zone. But things have dramatically changed. Today, it’s crammed with pubs. The streets are overflowing with beer-swilling locals and visitors. There are also art galleries, theaters, and museums for daytime activities, but once the sun starts to descend upon the horizon, there’s just one thing to do in this atmospheric neighborhood: hit the pubs. </p>

<li><strong>MIDRANGE</strong>: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ie/the-clarence.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clarence Hotel</a> — In 1992, Bono and The Edge from U2 bought this ancient hotel. In 1996, it shut down to undergo a complete renovation. Since then, this 51-room hotel has been one of the coolest places to stay in Dublin. Be sure to have a pint at the famed in-house pub, the Octagon Bar. And keep an eye out for Bono! </li>

Liquor and the Lord: on the surface, this is what sums up The Liberties. The neighborhood, in the southwest of the historic center, is home to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Christ Church Cathedral, the Teeling Whiskey Distillery, and the Guinness Brewery. </p>
<p>But The Liberties has also become a headquarters for the city’s hipster set as well. If you’re a fan of finely brewed coffee, craft spirits, or funky boutiques, the Liberties is the neighborhood for you. </p>

<p><img alt="A busy street in the Stoneybatter neighborhood of Dublin, Ireland" height="395" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/dublinstay4.jpeg" width="675" /><br />
Located on the Northside, Stoneybatter and the adjacent Smithfield) have some of the most local vibes in the center of Dublin. Pubs like the Cobblestone, where you can hear “trad music” on a nightly basis, and L. Mulligan Grocer, a favorite foodie spot for high-quality pub grub, are worth going to even if you’re not staying in the neighborhood. Stoneybatter and Smithfield are also great places to while away an afternoon at a third-wave coffeehouse or an intimate pub. </p>
<p>Stoneybatter is, in fact, so “local” that there aren’t really any places to stay here. The best accommodation options are in neighboring Smithfield. </p>

<strong>Posted</strong>: 12/19/22 | December 19th, 2022</p>
<p>The term “budget travel” has long been synonymous with “cheap travel.” <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/find-travel-deals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Finding deals</a>, getting off the beaten path, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-eat-cheap-around-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eating at “non-touristy” (i.e. inexpensive) restaurants</a>, and <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-pick-a-good-hostel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">staying in hostels</a>. The budget traveler is on a quest for a “local” experience at a low cost. </p>
<p>During the 2010s, the rise of sharing economy websites like Airbnb, increased competition in the travel industry, and the growing number of budget airlines offering long-haul flights made traveling on less a lot easier to do. </p>
<p>And travelers took advantage: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/186743/international-tourist-arrivals-worldwide-by-region-since-2010/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">global tourism rose from 946 million annual travelers to 1.4 billion over the past decade</a>.</p>
<p>However, this spiraling growth created a lot of backlash among residents, as many destinations weren’t equipped to handle so many visitors driving around, clogging streets, and raising the cost of living. Plus, locals didn’t like feeling like they lived in a zoo, constantly being gawked at by tourists. </p>
<p>Pre-COVID, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/overtourism-solutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overtourism</a> became the hot industry topic. &#8220;How do we make travel more sustainable?&#8221; we all wondered.</p>
<p>And, despite the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/travel-price-tracker" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent rise in prices post-COVID</a>, traveling is still relatively affordable, <a href="https://simpleflying.com/50-years-airfares/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">especially compared to historical averages</a>. </p>
<p>But is inexpensive travel <em>really</em> a good thing? Should it be so cheap if it means it’s also unsustainable?</p>
<p>I know that’s a weird question for me to pose, as I’m in the business of budget travel. And don’t get me wrong: I don’t think travel should only be for the wealthy. Travel opens the mind. It helps people understand the world, those who live in it, and themselves. So, I want to be very clear that I am not advocating that travel be out of reach for all but the elite few. I think every person in the world should be able to see more than their little corner of the world. </p>
<p>But should we enable a type of mass tourism that creates a lot of environmental and social woes? </p>
<p>Looking around these days, I think we have too much of a good thing. I think there should be some tighter restrictions on travel so that we don’t love places to death. </p>
<p>I backpacked a lot back when Wi-Fi, apps, and smartphones were not widespread and you still had to use a paper guidebook to get around. (Even then, though, people would tell me how hard travel “back in the day” was and how easy I had it with the advent of online booking platforms.) </p>
<p>There were plenty of ways to travel cheap back then — it was just that the information you needed was harder to find. I learned so much that first year, but it was information discovered on the road, not online or in print. They were tips and tricks I found through people and experiences. </p>
<p>The growth of travel blogs like this one, as well as through social media, has made information about how to travel cheaply a lot easier to find. No tip is a secret that hasn’t already been shared. No place in the world doesn’t have at least a dozen articles written about it. And one no longer needs to roam the streets looking for a place to stay or eat. </p>
<p>Heck, type in “Thai” into Google Maps on your phone, and you’ll get nearby restaurant results with directions, saving you from wandering around!</p>
<p>All these new services and technological developments I mentioned in the beginning — coupled with easy access to information — have made travel so affordable so quickly that I don’t think most destinations have had time to adjust. </p>
<p>Take Airbnb. Its rise has led to overtourism, housing shortages, noise issues, and other social ills. Gone are the days when you are actually staying in someone’s home. Now, you are more likely to be in someone’s tenth rental property, where there are no standards or rules, especially regarding safety. </p>
<p>What happens if there’s a fire? Is everything up to code? Who knows! </p>
<p>And that cute neighborhood you wanted to enjoy so you can get a taste of local life? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/13/new-orleans-airbnb-treme-short-term-rentals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">That’s full of tourists staying in Airbnbs now too</a>. </p>
<p>And, like anyone else, <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/how-to-find-a-cheap-flight/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I don’t like paying a lot for airfare</a>, but all those cheap, short-haul flights mean lots of people going to places not designed to handle them all (see the weekend trips to <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/the-netherlands-travel-tips/amsterdam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a>). Plus, short-haul flights have the highest environmental impact. </p>
<p>Do we need a tax on frequent fliers? <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2022/12/03/frances-plan-to-ban-short-haul-domestic-flights-wins-approval-from-european-commission/?sh=902c35b2385f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Or restrictions like the ones we are seeing in France</a>.</p>
<p>With the rise of digital nomadism and remote work, people are getting up and moving in record numbers again. (Don’t get me started on those skirting visa and work rules.) <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-countries-ranging-from-indonesia-to-mexico-aim-to-attract-digital-nomads-locals-say-not-so-fast-189283" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This means lots of people living in places where they don’t pay taxes or adapt to the community, or where they cause other issues</a>. </p>
<p>Just look at Mexico City. I love it, but the increase in the number of Americans living there has produced a big backlash among locals, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-07-27/americans-are-flooding-mexico-city-some-mexicans-want-them-to-go-home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who are now getting priced out of their own neighborhoods</a>. </p>
<p>And think about waste. Plastic bags, electricity, even your poop. I’m sure it’s a subject you never really consider when you travel. But what happens to all the waste you produce? Are the power plants, sewer systems, and trash management systems of that beautiful Greek island meant for the 20 million extra people it sees a year? No. They aren’t. </p>
<p>And cruises! <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/cruise-industry-faces-choppy-seas-it-tries-clean-up-its-act-climate-2022-07-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cruises cause a lot of problems</a> (and I say that as someone who likes them). <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8bceef94-86cd-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In 2017, Carnival&#8217;s alone caused ten times more sulfur oxide air pollution than all of Europe&#8217;s cars (over 260 million) combined</a>! That $50-a-night cruise might get more people moving — but not so sustainably. Santorini during cruise season is a nightmare.</p>
<p>The solutions to these problems are complex and will require the industry, consumers, and governments to work together to make sure tourism is sustainable. </p>
<p>You can’t stop people in popular destinations from wanting to make money to feed their families. And I don’t blame a lot of locals, especially those on the lower end of the economic spectrum, choosing living over protecting a nearby marsh. </p>
<p>I think, as travelers, we should be more willing to vote with our dollars and decide: are we going to be good and make sure we leave no trace, or are we there to treat destinations as zoos, parachuting in for a “local experience,” taking a few photos, and then heading off, leaving a wake of social and environmental headaches for the residents who live there?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s not the budget traveler who is causing a lot of these issues (they tend to avoid big hotels, eat local food, take public transportation, and stay longer). But they still cause some. A body is a body.</p>
<p>This leads me back to my original question: should travel be so cheap that it causes so many people to descend on <a href="https://www.fodors.com/news/news/fodors-no-list-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain destinations they buckle under the strain</a>? </p>
<p>While we all want to spend less, I think it’s time to ask ourselves what are we taking and what are we leaving? What is the impact of cheap travel on destinations and the people who live there?</p>
<p>Yes, hotels and traditional guesthouses are more expensive, but, unlike Airbnb, they are licensed and don’t take away from the local housing stock. </p>
<p>Yes, a train might be slower and more expensive, but short-haul flights are worse for the environment. </p>
<p>Yes, we all want to see Venice in the summer, but the city can’t support that many people at once. </p>
<p>I think the solution is not <em>less</em> travel but <em>better</em> travel.</p>
<p>When I see cities imposing taxes and fees and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/venice-florence-airbnb-restrictions/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restrictions on things like Airbnb</a> and cruises, I can’t help but say, “Good!” There <em>should</em> be more restrictions on Airbnb and cruises, as well as other forms of mass tourism, to ensure that destinations can handle the crowds and that the locals are not displaced or otherwise negatively impacted. </p>
<p>Over the last few years, we here have put a real focus on sustainable travel, <a href="https://thenomadicnetwork.com/tours/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alternative tours</a>, getting away from Airbnb, traveling in the off-season, and reducing waste, because I’ve become a lot more conscious of the negative impact travel can have when there is unfettered growth. </p>
<p>I think everyone should travel, but the unintended consequences that the rise of cheap travel has created need to be addressed. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/sustainable-travel-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As travelers, we can do a lot</a>. We can avoid environmentally harmful travel, reduce our flight use, avoid Airbnb, and go to “second-tier” destinations — or at the very least not the tourist centers of overcrowded cities. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2022/06/17/overtourism-from-venice-to-marseilles-heres-how-european-travel-hotspots-are-tackling-over" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As “top-tier” destinations crack down on overtourism</a>, people will have to go to other cities, which will spread the tourist numbers and dollars around while also showcasing new destinations and unclogging more popular cities.</p>
<p>Plus, when you go where the crowds <em>aren’t</em>, you tend to have more unique and fun experiences.</p>
<p>Will more rules and restrictions lead to higher prices? Probably. Does that mean not as many people might get to visit Machu Picchu or Petra or Japan? Possibly. </p>
<p>And, as someone who wants more people to travel, I admit that that kind of sucks. Even though there are plenty of other destinations to choose from, it still sucks that some of these changes will lead to some people being unable to visit some of them.</p>
<p>But, as we think about sustainable travel and its impact on the world, we can’t deny that people moving around in such large numbers has negative consequences. We need to come to grips with the fact that many places can’t handle so many people and that some restrictions are needed if we hope to keep them around, even if that means we won’t be able to see them all. </p>
<p>Travel is a give-and-take relationship between the destination and the visitor. We must be willing to give a little more and take a little less. </p>
<p>Our job as travelers is to make sure we aren&#8217;t hurting the locals and the environment. That means traveling as sustainably as possible and doing no harm to the local community.</p>
<p>Because there’s no point in going somewhere and then leaving it worse off. We can’t love places to death.<br />

            <link>https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-books-2022/</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Posted: 12/20/2022 &amp;#124; December 20th, 2022 For the last five years, I’ve

<strong>Posted</strong>: 12/20/2022 | December 20th, 2022</p>
<p>For the last five years, I’ve concluded the year with a list of my favorite reads. As a writer, reading comes with the territory. Writers just tend to read a lot. Then again, I’ve always been into reading ever since I was a little kid. I devour books. In a good year, I’ll read close to 80. </p>
<p>This year was not one of those years. I only read about 50 books. </p>
<p>As I compiled this list, I couldn’t help but notice that I gravitated a lot more to history, literature, and self-improvement than I had in the past. Though this is a travel website and I like to read a lot of travel books, I’ve found that so many fall into the same narrative arc that I just needed a break from <em>another</em> book on someone quitting their job to travel. </p>
<p>Instead, I’ve gotten a lot more into destination-specific travelogues rather than personal travelogues. That got me down a history rabbit hole and it’s where I’ve stayed most of the year. </p>
<p>I wonder if that will change in the new year. What will next year bring? Who knows!</p>
<p>Here’s what I loved this year though:</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://amzn.to/3FYQ6Ki" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sahara Unveiled</a>, by William Langewiesche</h3>
<p> <a href="https://amzn.to/3VWlrTl" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Sahara Unveiled book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/saharaunveiled.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>Written by journalist William Langewiesche in the 1990s, this book is beautifully detailed and wonderfully written. I was hooked by the punchy prose from page one. Langewiesche travels from Algeria through Niger and Mali before finishing in Dakar. Along the way, he offers deep insight into the culture and history of the region at a time when there was a lot of change happening. A fascinating snapshot in time.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="https://amzn.to/3Fw1pYM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Endurance: Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage</a>, by Alfred Lansing</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3Fw1pYM" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Endurance book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/endurancecover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a> This iconic book is about Ernest Shackleton’s epic journey to cross Antarctica in 1914. While trying to reach the South Pole, his boat got stuck in the ice and he and his crew were forced to abandon ship and walk north in hope of being rescued by a passing whaling boat. This book highlights their journey and survival as they spend over a year on the ice. It was absolutely riveting to read and a testament to the strong will and skill of the men involved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://amzn.to/3HI6HDh" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Deepest South of All: True Stories from Natchez, Mississippi</a>, by Richard Grant</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3HI6HDh" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The Deepest South of All book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/thedeepestsouthofallcover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>Richard Grant is a UK writer who moved to Missisppi and has been writing some great stuff about the state for years (<a href="https://amzn.to/2vESQt2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">check out his last book</a>, which is one of my all time favorites). This book is about the beautiful town of Natchez, a place I visited about six years back and really loved. In it, he talks about this weird quirky town and how it&#8217;s grappling with its past. He interviews all sorts of unique people and dives into the city&#8217;s history and customs. It&#8217;s travel writing at its best.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. <a href="https://amzn.to/3V8tdbx" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Far Land: 200 Years of Murder, Mania, and Mutiny in the South Pacific</a>, by Brandon Presser</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3V8tdbx" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The Far Land book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/thefarlandcover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>This book recaps the famous <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em> from the 1700s. The Royal navy mutineers ended up on the modern-day island of Pitcairn and the book traces the mutiny. I never really knew much about this incident and it was really interesting to see what happened to the crew who made it home and what happened to those who mutinied (and the island culture they created).</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. <a href="https://amzn.to/3V8rFOE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</a>, by Oliver Burkeman</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3V8rFOE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Four Thousand Weeks book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/fourthousandweekscover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>I liked this book so much that I read it twice. It utterly changed my life and how I view time. The gist is this: there will never be enough time to do everything, so don’t try. Get used to the fact that some things just won’t get done, and that when you do “master email” all you do is add more emails to your list. It is an anti-time-management book and has profoundly influenced the way I now look at time and what I do with it. I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. It was my favorite book of the year.</p>

<h3>6. <a href="https://amzn.to/3uYmciT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Do Nothing: How to Break Away from Overworking, Overdoing, and Underliving</a>, by Celeste Headlee</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/feed/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Do Nothing book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/donothingcover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>This book was recommended to me by a friend who also read my new favorite book, <em>Four Thousand Weeks</em> (see above). <em>Do Nothing</em>, rather than being a book on the nature of time, is more about how we need to separate work and play and have more room to be &#8220;bored.&#8221; We view busyness as a good thing but this book says creating holes in our calendar allows us to process our thoughts and be creative. It&#8217;s a lot more focused on work/life balance and very much a good second read after <em>Four Thousand Weeks</em>.</p>

<h3>7. <a href="https://amzn.to/3WeTqa0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life</a>, by Luke Burgis</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3WeTqa0" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Wanting book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/wantingbookcover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>This book is about how, whether we realize it or not, we mimic all behavior we see and how there&#8217;s really no such thing as independent thought. We are all influenced, consciously and subconsciously, by models in our lives (think about how you didn&#8217;t feel like pizza until you saw someone else eating it) and we then mimic that behavior. It was a fascinating look at how we all make decisions.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<h3>8. <a href="https://amzn.to/3HFVdQS" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">From Scratch: A Memoir of Love, Sicily, and Finding Home</a>, by Tembi Locke</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3HFVdQS" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Born a Crime book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/fromscratchcover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>Set in the lush Sicilian countryside, Tembi discovers the healing powers of food, family, and unexpected grace after her husband dies. <em>From Scratch: A Memoir of Love, Sicily, and Finding Home</em> is a captivating story of love lost and found (it was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller too). I absolutely loved the powerful imagery and emotion of this book. I teared up so many times. It&#8217;s an incredible read.</p>

<h3>9. <a href="https://amzn.to/3YvtFng" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to Hide an Empire: A History of the Greater United States</a>, by Daniel Immerwahr</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3YvtFng" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="How to Hide an Empire book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/howtohideanempire.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>This book chronicles the history of the United States empire. It covers how the country grew, acquired overseas expansions, how &#8220;mainland&#8221; Americans felt about it, and how US dominance after World War II influenced the world map. Even today, the US has lots of territories and overseas possessions that we never really think about (see Doug Mack&#8217;s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2vmsgCm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Not-Quite States of America</a></em> for a travel version of this). While dense, the book illuminates a lot of history that we don&#8217;t really talk about.</p>

<h3>10. <a href="https://amzn.to/3PDiHIj" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Northland: A 4,000-Mile Journey Along America&#8217;s Forgotten Border</a>, by Porter Fox</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3PDiHIj" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Scotland Beyond the Bagpipes book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/northlandcover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>Porter Fox grew up in Maine and, after a life of travel, decides to learn more about the US/Canada border. So, starting in Maine, he heads west tracing the border, learning about its history and meeting interesting people all the way to Washington. With a lot of vivid descriptions and historical background, Fox weaves together a really wonderful travel book.</p>

<h3>11. <a href="https://amzn.to/3jeDXYL" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Song of Achilles</a>, by Madeline Miller</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3jeDXYL" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The Song of Achilles book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/thesongofachillescover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>Last year, I read <a href="https://amzn.to/3jdLRxG" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Circe</a> by Madeline Miller and many of you recommended picking up her first book, <em>The Song of Achilles</em>, which tells the tale of Achilles from the perspective of his love, Patroclus. While I didn&#8217;t like this as much as <em>Circe</em> (mostly because she advanced so much as a writer in her second book), this book was still phenomenally written. It&#8217;s an amazing first book. If you haven&#8217;t read anything by Miller, definitely pick up both because you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>

<h3>12. <a href="https://amzn.to/3jfwQiV" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to Be a Family: The Year I Dragged My Kids Around the World to Find a New Way to Be Together</a>, by Dan Kois</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3jfwQiV" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="How to Be a Family book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/howtobeafamily.jpeg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a>Dan Kois and his family are in a rut in their suburban life. So, he and his wife decide to take their two daughters on a trip around the world in hopes of finding ways to be closer as a family. I found this book to be really insightful with hilarious prose and astute observations. In certain parts, you get to hear from his kids too on their version of the stories he tells.</p>

<h3>13. <a href="https://amzn.to/3BMkmFD" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s Darkest Journey</a>, by Candice Millard</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3BMkmFD" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="River of Doubt book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/riverofdoubt.jpeg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a></p>
<p>This book traces Theodore Roosevelt&#8217;s journey through the River of Doubt. After he lost the Presidential election in 1912, he had the opportunity to go down to Brazil. Originally supposed to be an easy trip, he opts to map the River of Doubt with Cândido Rondon, a Brazilian Colonel put in charge of him. Along the way, they get sick, have frightening encounters with natives, have to deal with murder, and experience a lack of provisions as they map this never-before-mapped river. It was an eye-opening read.</p>

<h3>14. <a href="https://amzn.to/3jhFY6g" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30 Lessons for Living: Tried and True Advice from the Wisest Americans</a>, by Karl Pillemer</h3>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3jhFY6g" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="30 Lessons for Living book cover" src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/30lessonsforlivingcover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px;" width="180" /></a></p>
<p>This book focuses on 30 lessons learned from people at the end of their life. Pillemer interviews hundreds of seniors to find out what their biggest lessons in life were and then distills it down to 30 that cut across work, life, relationships, marriage, money, success, friendship, and more. At 41, I have learned a lot of these lessons already but it was a good reminder of what is important and what is worth spending my time and energy on. It&#8217;s definitely a book anyone, especially those who are young, should read.</p>

<h3>15. <a href="https://amzn.to/3FBTA3W" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Vagabond&#8217;s Way: 366 Meditations on Wanderlust, Discovery, and the Art of Travel</a>, by Rolf Potts</h3>

<p>Rolf is one of the original budget travel experts and his first book <em>Vagabonding</em> is a travel classic. His newest book is all about bringing your adventurous, curious, and open-minded travel mindset home with you. With insightful quotes and reflections, the book showcases just how much travel is a way of life and not just the act of &#8220;going somewhere.&#8221; After years of limited travel due to COVID, this book is the perfect reminder that travel is a mindset that should be embraced anywhere and everywhere you go.</p>
