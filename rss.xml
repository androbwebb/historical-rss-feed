Keep me accountable and see if I reach them all (I bet I will)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Become FULLY polyphasic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m working hard on this one and am almost there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gain 15 lb of lean muscle&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8211; This will leave me at 160lb and around 8% body fat. To achieve this one I&amp;#8217;m going to sign up for &lt;a href="http://www.vizualxcellence.com/"&gt;SwoleCat&amp;#8217;s program&lt;/a&gt;. He comes highly recommended and doesn&amp;#8217;t advise eating processed foods. As before I will have a strict diet and exercise plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make a million dollars by my birthday this year &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of time to do this (just a few months), but it has been my goal for many years to make $1mil before I turn 25. This applies to my net worth so if I can create some valuable business by then, it will count. I have started this blog, which I hope will start generating some revenue. I have also started selling ebooks. My first is called &lt;a href="http://www.theskinnysnob.com"&gt;The Skinny Snob&lt;/a&gt; and is a very high quality diet book. For future books I am working with some very talented friends in California. I have a few other business ideas that I will write about as I begin doing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Become a relatively well known rapper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; This might surprise some readers, but I am a rapper. Several years ago I got into rap and resolved to practice it every day. At first I couldn&amp;#8217;t rhyme two lines together, but now I can freestyle and write decent songs. &lt;a href="http://www.soundclick.com/dzk"&gt;DZK&lt;/a&gt; is quite possibly the best rapper I&amp;#8217;ve ever heard, and he has helped me hone my skills as well. I also go to &lt;a href="http://www.tambaleo.com"&gt;Krunkeoke&lt;/a&gt;, which is rap karaoke, every Wednesday to practice my delivery and stage presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find and date one incredible girl OR date several great girls &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8211; For this one I&amp;#8217;m going to have to stop working all the time and find some social activities I enjoy besides going out at night. I&amp;#8217;d like to do yoga again, so I think that will be a good start. Also Tyler from &lt;a href="http://www.realsocialdynamics.com"&gt;Real Social Dynamics&lt;/a&gt; is going to be workshopping me later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enlarge my social circle&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8211; Over the past couple years a lot of friends have moved away, and I have moved away from my friends in Los Angeles. This leaves me with few but very high quality friends. I&amp;#8217;d like to have more high quality friends. I don&amp;#8217;t really have a plan of attack for this one &amp;#8211; I think that if I take care of the others, this will fall into place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do something REALLY nice for someone or a group of people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t really do a lot of GREAT things for people, just an occasional good thing. This will probably come in the form of me finally starting Nice Day. More details on that in the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think these are pretty challenging yet realistic goals. It&amp;#8217;s important to remember that I have much more time than the average person, thanks to my polyphasic sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/goals-for-2006/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/goals-for-2006/#comments</comments><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2006 01:11:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A Lucid Dream</title><link>https://tynan.com/a-lucid-dream/</link><description>I had my first lucid dream since beginning this thing.

&lt;p&gt;I had woken up naturally after about 15 minutes of sleep, and as I was drifting back into dreamland, I realized that I was sleeping right as I started to dream. I thought &amp;#8220;wow&amp;#8230; let&amp;#8217;s try out this lucid dream stuff&amp;#8221; and leapt off some stairs. I hit the pavement and it felt like real pain, although it didn&amp;#8217;t last. Then I figured that I needed to think about flying, and as soon as I did, I could feel myself being yanked way into the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a strange experience. I could barely see what was happening in the dream&amp;#8230; everything was really fuzzy. But I could feel it as if it was actually happening. I woke up after just a minute or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;#8217;ve made two improvements to my alarm. The first is that I&amp;#8217;ve made the brown noise quieter. Sometimes it would bother me when I was trying to get to sleep. I also extended the nap portion of it by 7 minutes, bringing it to 32 minutes total before the alarm goes off. I did that because it takes me about 7 minutes to fall asleep usually. Sometimes I&amp;#8217;ll want to go blow my nose or put on a robe before sleeping, but don&amp;#8217;t want to infringe on my precious sleep time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should give me more pleasant naps, but also 42 more minutes of sleep per day. This should help quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/a-lucid-dream/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/a-lucid-dream/#comments</comments><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2006 12:42:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Polyphasic Sleeping in Paradise</title><link>https://tynan.com/polyphasic-sleeping-in-paradise/</link><description>I&amp;#8217;m wearing an offensively soft egyptian terry cotton robe right now.

I just got out of the solid marble steam room that&amp;#8217;s in my bathroom. Before that I was soaking with some lavender sea salts in the raised jacuzzi tub, also off my bedroom. Before that I was having my ass kissed by a variety of casino employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s right, I&amp;#8217;m in the penthouse suite of the Luxor hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a friend of mine called me to ask how to play Blackjack. He was at the luxor playing rather large hands of blackjack. So large, in fact, that they offered him the penthouse suite, which must be at least 4000 sq. ft. He offered to fly me up to occupy the second bedroom of the suite. At first I declined &amp;#8211; I don&amp;#8217;t like to accept favors I can&amp;#8217;t repay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while he convinced me, though. He argued that he would probably save much more than the airfare if I sat with him and showed him what to do. After a twice delayed flight (took my polynaps in the plane and presidents&amp;#8217; club in the airport) I arrived at McCarran airport, greeted by a private limo sent courtesy of the Luxor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d heard about casino hosts, so I did some research and got in touch with one of the top hosts in the world. Immediately he offered my friend a free trip to Vegas, highlighted by a trip via private jet to Houston to watch the Heat vs. the Rockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to leave me out, my friend split his bankroll with me so that we could both play in the high limit blackjack area. Of course I return all winnings to him (although he has generously offered some of them to me), and wouldn&amp;#8217;t be liable for losses. But the real benefit is that now the casino sees ME as a high roller, so I can go on trips like the basketball one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, until Tuesday I will be living life like a high roller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of this post is mostly to brag about how great my life is. I mean&amp;#8230; the point of this post is that this experience so far has been incredibly motivating. THIS is how life should be lived. I love Vegas and have had some awesome trips here, but none quite like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#8217;m going to post tons of pictures of the suite. I always wanted to see what they looked like on the inside, but could never find pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/polyphasic-sleeping-in-paradise/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/polyphasic-sleeping-in-paradise/#comments</comments><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2006 03:08:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The World’s Most Expensive Manicure</title><link>https://tynan.com/the-worlds-most-expensive-manicure/</link><description>As some of you may know, I paint my nails silver.

Why? Everyone always asks, but the real answer is just because I think it&amp;#8217;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read this article about &lt;a href="http://www.essie.com/press/index.php?sub=events"&gt;platinum nailpolish&lt;/a&gt; I was really excited. The polish is called &amp;#8220;I do&amp;#8221; by Essie.One of my favorite things is excess, so I figured $250/ year to have my nails coated with real platinum was a bargain. I had the Amex concierge call around to try to find me a bottle, and they reported back that the only place to get the polish was at the Wynn in Vegas. Not only that, but you can&amp;#8217;t just buy a bottle of it. You need to get their very expensive manicure which includes the bottle. So yesterday I headed over to the Wynn to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The salon in the Wynn is gorgeous. It&amp;#8217;s huge and very well decorated. As they do at many spas, they offered me a drink. I don&amp;#8217;t drink, so I got water. It always strikes me as a weird offer, though. I manage to take a few sips, and then my hands are being worked on for a little over an hour, making it impossible to drink the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manicure is absolutely ridiculous. I would have taken notes or something if I knew I was going to report back here about it. I&amp;#8217;d say that roughly 7-8 different oils, scrubs, and waxes were applied to my hands during the whole process. My forearms were massaged three times. The detail paid to my cuticles was intense. I can honestly say I don&amp;#8217;t even understand WHY cuticles need to be removed, but rest assured that mine are completey gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight was the paraffin wax treatment. My manicurist plunged my hands into a vat of hot wax. When I saw the vat and its contents it looked like fondue, and I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to put my hands into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my handes came out, they were dripping with with gooey warm wax and wrapped in plastic. It was particularly pleasant because the wax holds the heat well and kept my hands warm for a while. Removing the wax is easy &amp;#8211; it just peels off like a glove. My hands felt really soft after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway&amp;#8230; after the hour long ritual it finally came time to apply the polish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not platinum colored. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that when I first heard of the polish I thought that it was strange that it was platinum colored, since I&amp;#8217;ve never seen anyone with silver nails who hasn&amp;#8217;t gotten the idea from me. The color is somewhere between clear and white. A bit&amp;#8230; subtle for my tastes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big problem I face (yeah&amp;#8230; life&amp;#8217;s tough) is that I can only find low quality silver nail polish. In fact, the Wynn had hundreds of colors, but no silver. I opted for two coats of a silver glitter, topped with a layer of the platinum polish. It looks pretty cool, but I like the silver look better. I&amp;#8217;ll probably try a layer of the platinum over the silver next time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/the-worlds-most-expensive-manicure/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/the-worlds-most-expensive-manicure/#comments</comments><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2006 14:39:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Pictures of the Luxor Penthouse</title><link>https://tynan.com/pictures-of-the-luxor-penthouse/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="180" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smalllux-2.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 75%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="240" /&gt;As I wrote in a previous article, I stayed for a few days in the Luxor Penthouse Suite.

&lt;p&gt;We have plans to go back to Vegas already. The Golden Nugget is going to fly us out to Vegas, and then fly to Houston via private jet to see the Miami Heat vs. Houston Rockets game. I&amp;#8217;m not actually a basketball fan, but I like seeing games live and have always wanted to ride in a private jet. Also, the Luxor has invited us to see the Mosley vs. Vargas boxing match. Expect pictures of both, and many other events to come&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ve got two hours left before it&amp;#8217;s tomorrow and I don&amp;#8217;t have the picture I need to do the update I want, so we&amp;#8217;re going into the vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago I put the biggest above ground pool I could find in my living room. The pictures were posted to a bunch of those link collecting sites and almost 7000 people saw the pictures the first day. Every year or so they are rediscovered and they get a ton of hits. However, I&amp;#8217;ve never publicly told the story of the pool and why I did it. Avast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day my friend Crystal sends me an IM. Here&amp;#8217;s a dramatic rendition of the event :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crystal: &lt;/strong&gt;OMG! Ty, check out www.penguinwarehouse.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, it&amp;#8217;s a site that apparently sells pet penguins. I didn&amp;#8217;t realize it before that moment, but I had always wanted a pet penguin. Probably everyone has. I just never thought it was possible. Penguin Warehouse assured me that it was in fact possible :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Q:  Do I need to provide a habitat for my penguin?&lt;br /&gt;
A:  Most certainly!  Each penguin species requires unique habitat requirements and your home environment needs to be made suitable for a penguin before purchase of such a pet.  Most penguins require a decent sized salt-water non-chlorinated pool set at an appropriate temperature.  In fact, some penguin species spend as much as  75% of their life in water.  If you are interested in learning more, please look into one of our many penguin care books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I was sold. If only I had a decent sized non-chlorinated pool. I sent an e-mail to the proprietors at Penguin Warehouse asking all the questions I had, and telling them I was ready to order. They had a variety of breeds and ages available, and after a couple hours of research, I decided on a Snares Island penguin. I was going to name him Magellan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really excited. So excited, in fact, that I told everyone I knew that I was getting a pet penguin. Knowing me, most people weren&amp;#8217;t too surprised, and most were excited by the idea as well. My parents offered the opinion that buying a penguin was a reckless and irresponsible thing to do. This was a very frequently offered opinion, however, so it was discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that week I found myself at Costco buying frozen fruit. While wandering the aisles I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but notice the large swimming pool in display. They had it sitting on its edge, and it towered over the shoppers at a height of 15 feet. I immediately thought that it would be really cool if I had a pool that big at my house. The only problem is that my backyard is small and the robomower might cut the pool up. I considered putting it in the garage, but decided that I like parking there too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me that I could just put it in my living room. I had just moved into my house and didn&amp;#8217;t have a dining table. I could easily move the living room furniture in there and put the pool in the living room. I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure it would even fit, but I figured it was worth a try. My friends Jake and Crystal cautioned me that it could easily be a disaster, but I could tell that they really wanted to see it happen. I called my father, who is a carpenter, to see what he thought. I believe his quote was something like this :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I know I always tell you not to do your crazy ideas and you usually do anyway, but listen to me on this one. Don&amp;#8217;t do it. You could crack your foundation or flood your house&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was enough to sway me. I made a little flow chart for you guys to help understand how I make decisions. If you want your life to be more interesting, try following it yourself with your decisions :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flowchart" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/flow.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it had to be done. I picked up one of the huge boxes containing the inflatable pools and put it in my cart. I checked out and had to drive home at about 10mph because the pool only fit halfway in my trunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we cleared all of the furniture out of the room and unpacked the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we unrolled the ground tarp. I didn&amp;#8217;t know if I actually needed this, since the manufacturers carelessly ignored the possibility of indoor installation. In the end I decided to use it, because you can never be too safe when installing a pool in your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the pool would be environmentally friendly, Crystal simulated a retarded dolphin swimming in the dry pool. It was a great success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="3" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the pool works is that the outer ring is inflated, and as the pool is filled with water the ring rises and causes the pool to form its shape. Whoever came up with this idea is a genius madman. I&amp;#8217;m sure that outdoors it&amp;#8217;s a walk in the park, but doing this inside was quite nervewracking. I can&amp;#8217;t really describe the nervous feeling of standing in the middle of the living room with the hose at full blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="4" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we waited&amp;#8230; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="5" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;and waited&amp;#8230; The pool was 3100 gallons, which is a lot more water than it seemed. As the pool slowly grew we&amp;#8217;d marvel every five minutes at how cool it was. I actually had to stop for the night and restart the next morning. I believe it took around 8 hours total to get the sucker filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="6" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the pool was completely full. Eager to celebrate, we tested the water. That&amp;#8217;s when it dawned on me that the pool was never going to get any warmer than 72 degrees &amp;#8211; for some reason I just thought outdoor pool = cold and indoor pool = warm. Oops. I was somewhat comforted by the fact that Magellan would probably appreciate the cold water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="7" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake insisted that we try it out anyway, so we did. It&amp;#8217;s very bizarre to be floating comfortably along in the pool while staring at the ceiling fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="8" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="9" src="http://old.tynan.com/pool/9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;#8217;t count on was the paranoia that the pool caused. I would routinely wake up, convinced that I heard a noise, and I would run my hand along the entire perimeter of the pool. The pool was 15 feet in diameter and barely fit into the room, so this was a bit of a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days later I started getting suspicious because the Penguin Warehouse people hadn&amp;#8217;t written me back yet. One of my friends took a closer look at the site and realized that it is obviously a fake. He told me, and despite a brief attempt to cling to my hopes, I had to relent. A second look at the web site made it very clear that it was just a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With cold water and no penguin to occupy it, I was ready to get rid of the pool. Siphoning the water out was surprisingly easy. I put one end of a hose in the water, and brought the other end to the back edge of my property. Without any work on my part, the water started flowing. It was as if immaculate sucking had occured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neighbor came by with the bad news that I must have a leak in my sprinkler system because water was pumping out of my backyard at an alarming pace. He was a bit freaked out when I invited him in and he saw the pool. He never came by again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to get the last drops of water out, I dragged the pool outside and put it on the deck, where it sat for a couple months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read about Costco&amp;#8217;s incredible return policy &amp;#8211; essentially anything can be returned for any reason. We loaded the whole moldy mess onto my friend&amp;#8217;s pickup truck &amp;#8211; there was no chance it was fitting in its box. And hauled it to costco. Using a large shopping cart to transport it, I dumped the pool and its accessories in front of the returns counter, causing a bit of a scene. Here&amp;#8217;s how the conversation went down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tynan : I&amp;#8217;d like to return this swimming pool.&lt;br /&gt;
Woman : Is there something wrong with it?&lt;br /&gt;
Tynan : No.&lt;br /&gt;
Woman : Then why do you want to return it?&lt;br /&gt;
Tynan : Well, I put it in my house because I was going to buy a penguin, but I kept worrying that it was going to leak on my carpet. It&amp;#8217;s not as sturdy as the one you had on display (this is true &amp;#8211; the one on display was double walled)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman definitely did not believe me and just stared blankly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woman : I.. umm. I don&amp;#8217;t think we can take this return. I&amp;#8217;m going to get a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manager: Sir, can you tell me why you&amp;#8217;d like to return this pool?&lt;br /&gt;
Tynan : I was going to buy a penguin, but I was worried the pool was going to leak on my carpet. It doesn&amp;#8217;t say anywhere not to use it inside, but I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s sturdy enough.&lt;br /&gt;
Manager: Are you being serious?&lt;br /&gt;
Tynan: Yes.&lt;br /&gt;
Manager: Ok&amp;#8230; I guess we&amp;#8217;ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I provided my receipt and got my money back. Not getting the penguin was a very sad event for me. I had already named Magellan and was extremely excited. I had read tons of information about penguins and was really excited about taking care of him. Since &amp;#8220;losing&amp;#8221; him, I have visited two aquariums and spent as much time with the penguins as possible. For Christmas my awesome sister bought me a plastic penguin named Magellan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/the-infamous-ghetto-indoor-pool/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/the-infamous-ghetto-indoor-pool/#comments</comments><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2006 15:26:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Triple Monitors : Why Going out of Business is Fun</title><link>https://tynan.com/triple-monitors-why-going-out-of-business-is-fun/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="263" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/trip-2.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 75.14%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="350" /&gt;Want to know what the best part of your business coming to a screeching halt is?

&lt;p&gt;Also, I went to &lt;strike&gt;Home Depot&lt;/strike&gt; Jacob the Jeweler and got some sick bling today. Composed &lt;strike&gt;mostly&lt;/strike&gt; entirely out of &lt;strike&gt;stainless steel&lt;/strike&gt; fine platinum, it weighs in at 6 pounds. Besides being horribly uncomfortable around the neck, it punches me in the stomach with the lock as I walk. I consider the purchase an overwhelming success. One of my good friends is throwing a party tomorrow night, and I plan on rocking the chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt="Me" src="http://old.tynan.com/chain.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. I know I put this same picture up a couple days ago &amp;#8211; but there&amp;#8217;s a reason. Someone STOLE my chain last night. I am incapable of taking another picture with the chain now. Here&amp;#8217;s how the caper went down :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine was having a birthday party. Because it was important to me that his party be cool, I lugged over my huge subwoofer, a projector, my laptop, and all the cables and stuff. I also spent a good part of my day downloading music videos. I even skipped a nap to set it up. And it should be said that I hate doing any sort of manual labor, but I carried that subwoofer up the stairs to the party. Ok, so I didn&amp;#8217;t heal any sick children or anything, but the point is that I made a genuine effort to contribute to this party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I also wore my chain, hat, and other interesting accoutrements. Of course, throughout the night, many people wanted to try on the chain. Why not? Everyone&amp;#8217;s got a little gangsta in them, and it&amp;#8217;s healthy to express that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait&amp;#8230; let&amp;#8217;s get this out in the open first : there were no hot girls here. There were a couple girls who were cute, flirty, and who I genuinely enjoyed the company of. So I&amp;#8217;m not saying I was really upset about the whole thing, but it needs to be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone asked to wear my chain, I was usually happy to oblige. The thing is really heavy and does hurt to wear. Everyone got to wear it except for one girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting down having a lovely conversation with a couple friends and a couple new people I met. All of a sudden, someone from behind is trying to remove my chain. Without asking. Ugly girls do crap like this ALL THE TIME (usually with the hat). Of course I bust on her for having no manners, and instead of apologizing and ASKING to wear the chain, she tugs harder and says something like &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have to ask, I&amp;#8217;m a girl&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look up at her and realize that she&amp;#8217;s a beast with no manners or social grace, so I tell her point blank &amp;#8220;Look, at this point there&amp;#8217;s no way you&amp;#8217;re going to get to wear the chain&amp;#8221;. She leaves in a huff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the party wears on, it gets late and I&amp;#8217;m convinced that my collar bones are bruised. Most of the party goers are gone, and I had expensive electronics sitting on the counter that weren&amp;#8217;t getting stolen, so I felt like it would be ok for me to take off my chain. I put it in the middle of the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I finish up my last conversation for the night, I walk to the counter to retrieve my chain, and IT&amp;#8217;S MISSING. Someone actually STOLE my chain. So let me do a little recap for you :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tynan goes to the party and brings the music and videos&lt;br /&gt;
Tynan wears interesting things which lead to many nice little conversations for people&lt;br /&gt;
Tynan generously lets everyone but ONE GIRL wear the chain (and I&amp;#8217;d say that I was nice and didn&amp;#8217;t piss off at least 90% of the crowd)&lt;br /&gt;
Tynan is STOLEN FROM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable. I looked all over the place, and there was no chain in sight. It&amp;#8217;s not like anyone would even steal the chain to wear &amp;#8211; NO ONE else would wear that thing. AND I had the keys at home, so if that girl thinks she&amp;#8217;s going to chain her fridge closed or something, she&amp;#8217;s out of luck. There is NO benefit to stealing my chain except to deliberately piss me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man. I&amp;#8217;m pissed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/the-mystery-of-the-chain/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/the-mystery-of-the-chain/#comments</comments><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2006 14:31:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Polyphasic Upgrade / Update</title><link>https://tynan.com/polyphasic-upgrade-update/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="263" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/garfield-2.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 75.14%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="350" /&gt;Before I went to Massachusetts, things were peachy.

&lt;p&gt;Before I went to Massachusetts, things were peachy. I did 4 days with only one hour of oversleeping. Then during Massachusetts I did rather poorly, but still not too bad. When I got back I was settling back into my polyphasic/gangsta lifestyle, but that got interrupted for my trip to Vegas. And Vegas, surprisingly, wasn&amp;#8217;t kind to the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to get back on the boat, so to speak. Last night I only overslept by 90 minutes, but I just woke up from a 4 hour (!!!!) oversleep. So now, I confess that I&amp;#8217;ve been keeping something from you, dear reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never duct taped my laptop up after getting back from Mass. It&amp;#8217;s a pain to do, and I felt like I could handle the responsibility. I couldn&amp;#8217;t. Also, when I went to Vegas the &lt;a href="http://www.tynan.com/?p=76"&gt;air compressor&lt;/a&gt; got left on for a few days and burnt out. I&amp;#8217;ve been going without most of the safeguards I&amp;#8217;ve come to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#8230; tonight I ask for your forgiveness. As an offering, I have duct taped the laptop up once again, AND made a bit of an improvement on the compressor. I&amp;#8217;m now using a vacuum, which isn&amp;#8217;t quite as loud, BUT I have duct taped its power switch such that it can not be turned off. The module that controls whether it&amp;#8217;s on or off has been stuck behind the couch in the living room. So now it is absolutely impossible to turn off the alarm or vacuum without leaving the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alarm is impossible to turn off even if you do leave. The vacuum can be turned off if I make it to my computer, but it will automatically turn on again if I sleep by another 35 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway&amp;#8230; despite my somnarific indescretions, I&amp;#8217;m feeling good. To be honest I felt like a complete idiot when I overslept in Vegas. What a waste! It was only out of shame that I didn&amp;#8217;t update.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/polyphasic-upgrade-update/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/polyphasic-upgrade-update/#comments</comments><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2006 05:02:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Consider, Commit, Lock</title><link>https://tynan.com/consider-commit-lock/</link><description>People often comment that I have a lot of discipline.

Even if you go through some comments on posts in this blog, you&amp;#8217;ll see people saying that. I even agree with them &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve been working this polyphasic thing for over two months now! Very few nights have gone by that haven&amp;#8217;t involved an intense struggle to stave off sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that I used to be completely UNdisciplined. It was almost a joke amongst my friends and families. What changed? Read on&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that I didn&amp;#8217;t trust myself. If I said &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m going to not eat meat for 30 days&amp;#8221;, I knew that since I was undisciplined, that it might not actually be true. So when day three rolled around and I saw a hamburger, I&amp;#8217;d think subconciously, &amp;#8220;Well, I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to make it thirty days anyway&amp;#8221; and I&amp;#8217;d chow down. Even small things like saying &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m going to go to sleep after one more game&amp;#8221; would get stretched. My promises to myself were worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have a similar problem. I think most people do. Just look on wikipedia at all of the people who tried polyphasic sleeping. Some have been deleted, but the sad fact is that at least 95% of people have given up. They KNEW when they started that they might not follow through, so when they were tired at 5am one day, they just sighed and went back to sleep. The truth is that I am probably LESS suited to adapting to this than any of those people. I haven&amp;#8217;t had to use an alarm in years, I had no structure to my sleeping patterns, and I routinely slept for 9-10 hours per day. The only reason I&amp;#8217;m still doing it now is because from the very beginning I said I&amp;#8217;d stick to it no matter what. I have never even considered giving up, because of that commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what I semi-humbly submit as being the best way to make ANY decision :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take PLENTY of time to think through your decision. Think of how it will affect you. Do you have all of the information? If not, get it. Think of yourself as a robot &amp;#8211; you only get to program it once, so do it right. Make sure that in the moment you make this decision, you are confident about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that you&amp;#8217;ve gathered all the information you need to make a decision, commit to it. Write it down if you have to. Make sure that there is a distinct moment where you conciously commit that decision to your memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now your decision has been thoroughly thought through and made, so you lock it in. Under NO circumstances can you change that decision now. It sounds harsh, and it might lead you to take some incorrect actions from time to time. BUT&amp;#8230; if you don&amp;#8217;t follow this process you will waffle, give in, and make exponentially more errors. If necessary, you can add a safeguard into the commit process. I often say &amp;#8220;I will do XXXX for one month and then reevaluate&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real benefit to this sytem is that every decision you make is with a clear head. When the going gets rough and it&amp;#8217;s time to act, you&amp;#8217;ve already got your mind made up. Do you think I can REALLY make an informed decision to quit polyphasic sleeping when I&amp;#8217;m exhausted at 5am? Of course not! My sleepy-logic will say anything to let me go back to sleep. But, since I commited to polyphasic sleeping for life, I will never give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you a real world example that nearly every one of you readers will go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I was in a relationship. The girl was one of, if not the most, beautiful girls I&amp;#8217;d ever talked to, let alone dated. We&amp;#8217;d been together for almost a year and had some incredible experiences together. I loved her and she loved me. However, she drank too much, and I knew that because of that I would never marry her. We&amp;#8217;d been together long enough that she was talking about marriage, and was convinced that we would some day get married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that one day that I would have to break up with her. Despite the fact that I loved her, I knew that it was in my best interest, as well as hers, for us to break up. Also, she kept trying to quit drinking, but whenever she would start again (because of lack of discipline) it would upset me. This caused a lot more drama in my life than I needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tough decision, but I eventually committed to breaking up with her forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking up is never easy, but staying broken up is usually harder. How many couples do you know who do that miserable broken-up-one-second-back-together-the-next dance? Nearly every one. For me it was simple. I made my decision, so it never even occurred to me to consider taking her back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She called and called, wrote e-mails, and pushed all my buttons. And believe me, after a year of living together, she knows how to press my buttons. But, my resolve stayed strong, and eventually the calls tapered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m happily single and happier than when I was with her. I believe she is engaged and most likely very happy. Because I took the time to consider everything, I knew that this would be the right decision. Even though there were rough times during the process, I always had an over-arching feeling of confidence, and now that the dust has settled, it proved to be the right move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I hadn&amp;#8217;t been so firm in my decision, I may still be waffling back and forth between being with her breaking up &amp;#8211; NO ONE likes that part of a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is when I committed to eating nothing but healthy foods for a month. I cut out 95% of the foods that I used to eat and replaced them in many cases with foods that I wasn&amp;#8217;t fond of. Over the month my tastes changed and I ended up extending the committment by 7 more months. Even to this day I eat 100% healthy when I&amp;#8217;m at home, but decided to be more lenient when I am traveling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#8217;t think most people will be able to build this sort of decision-discipline overnight. I certainly didn&amp;#8217;t. For me it was a very difficult process because I was so extremely undisciplined. But, I developed a simple process to build this discipline forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start off small, but serious. Use the process on EVERY decision you make. This is what I did. I would conciously go through the process even doing such small things as eating lunch. Even though your brain knows it&amp;#8217;s a small thing, it still feels good to commit to making lunch and then eating it. Commit to vacuuming your room, to making a phone call that you need to make, or even to going bowling. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter WHAT the commitments are, it just matters that you begin establishing a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, remember to give yourself as much time as you need. An extra day of deciding is a far smaller loss than months of agonizing and flip-flopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are good with your small commitments, make larger ones. Eat NO sugar or refined flour for a week. Go for a jog every other day for two weeks. Pick things where you will never question your ability to do them, just your resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you do this, you will begin to create a mental record of how many commitments in a row you&amp;#8217;ve stuck to. As that record gets larger, you won&amp;#8217;t want to break it. In fact, I can commit to almost anything now because I will do anything to avoid breaking my record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take you a month or two to really build this skill, but it is one that will be with you for the rest of your life. When you build this trust in yourself you are better equipped to deal with anything that comes your way, and that in turn will build a tremendous confidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/consider-commit-lock/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/consider-commit-lock/#comments</comments><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2006 05:46:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How I Became a Famous Pickup Artist : Part 1</title><link>https://tynan.com/how-i-became-a-famous-pickup-artist-part-1/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="520" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/flow2-3.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 148.57%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="350" /&gt;As far as I was concerned, she was perfect.

She was at least as smart as I was, was a dancer and had the body to prove it, and had a smile that could disarm the national guard. Let&amp;#8217;s call her Julie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, like an earthworm stalking it&amp;#8217;s prey, I put my usual game on her. Since my last flowchart was so popular, I&amp;#8217;ve made another one to show you how I dealt with the ladies back then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://old.tynan.com/flow2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nedless to say, things went slowly. We hung out nearly every day for the last couple months of our Senior year summer vacation. Like many guys, I was totally oblivious to her attraction for me. One morning Julie came over really early while I was still sleeping, and squeezed into my twin bed with me. I woke up, and assumed that she must be tired &amp;#8211; it didn&amp;#8217;t even occur to me that she might like me. Finally on the last week of that vacation she said to me,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Tynan, I have something to confess to you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;re going to be really pissed at me&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ok&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I have a crush on you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Uhh&amp;#8230; Why would I be pissed? I have a crush on you too.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know&amp;#8230; I was a regular Cassanova. Later that night we made out for a solid 60 seconds or so, permanently bonding my heart to hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem was this : in two days she had to leave to go to college in Chicago. When she told me that she didn&amp;#8217;t want to do the whole long distance relationship thing, I was totally crushed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning that she was set to leave I woke up early to a knock on my door. My sleepy brain decided that it must be her, coming to say goodbye. I eagerly jumped out of bed and opened the door. It wasn&amp;#8217;t her, though. It was my RA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she spoke to me I found it difficult to concentrate on what she was saying&amp;#8230; after thirty seconds I couldn&amp;#8217;t focus my eyes on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I knew, she was hovered over me frantically yelling, &amp;#8220;Tynan! Are you ok? Ty?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood was pouring out of the side of my head and I felt faint. I had passed out, fallen sideways into the bathroom, and cracked my head on the toilet. They even called the paramedics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because I jumped out of bed so suddenly&amp;#8230; maybe it&amp;#8217;s because I was a wreck over Julie. Maybe a combination of those things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two years I didn&amp;#8217;t date anyone else. I wasn&amp;#8217;t even interested. I figured that she would move back after college and I could be with her then. It didn&amp;#8217;t even occur to me that this is totally creepy behaviour &amp;#8211; I just thought it was inevitable that we&amp;#8217;d be back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I was online and a friend showed me a site about picking up girls. I barely gave it a second look &amp;#8211; I was in love with Julie and didn&amp;#8217;t care about anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next year I briefly dated another girl, Dina, who was probably as close to perfect for me as they get. But&amp;#8230; still distracted with the memory of Julie, I never really got into it and I broke up with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I decided I needed to stop. It had been three years, Julie had a new boyfriend who she was serious about, and having my entire love life consist over one girl who was 2000 miles away was a bit sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then I was working for myself and was out of school, so I wasn&amp;#8217;t meeting too many eligible bachelorettes. I remembered that site that my friend had showed me, but couldn&amp;#8217;t recall the name. I turned to google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick up girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fastseduction.com/"&gt;Fast Seduction&lt;/a&gt;. That was it. I remembered the site because of it&amp;#8217;s unique purple and green color scheme. That night I read&amp;#8230; and I read and I read and I read. I stayed up all night reading every last bit of material I could get my hands on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe it was possible &amp;#8211; people were ACTUALLY learning the skill of meeting women. I had always subscribed to the notion that it was magic and chemistry and you either clicked or you didn&amp;#8217;t. Most girls that got to know me would become interested in me, but I didn&amp;#8217;t get to know a lot of girls. I was too shy, and I figured that was my lot in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this site actually taught how to go out and meet strangers and get to know them. I didn&amp;#8217;t even know it was possible. Even though I was 21, I had never been in a bar before. I had never gotten a girl&amp;#8217;s number (except this one girl who chased me in the airport&amp;#8230; more on that another day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few weeks I just devoured all of the information I could get my hands on. I learned how to start a conversation without seeming like I was trying to get something from her. I learned that there were different phases an interaction had to go through before a girl would be romantically interested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I learned about the subtle signs that indicate that a girl is attracted, I felt like an idiot. Julie had given me all of those signs at one point or another, as had many other girls who I thought were just friendly. From my later experience I learned that everyone goes through this process when they learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was embarrassed that I had to learn this stuff, though. Who wants to admit they&amp;#8217;re bad with girls? As a result, I didn&amp;#8217;t tell anyone I was learning it. Not even my close friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the knowledge I was soaking up, I still had yet to actually go talk to a girl. I noticed a guy posting in Austin, so I e-mailed him and asked if I could join him next time he went downtown. He said that they were having a meeting that weekend where they would discuss techniques and then go out. I agreed to come to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the day of the meeting came, I was having second thoughts. I was nervous. I was so socially anxious at that point that even meeting random GUYS scared me. I decided that I had to go, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I parked in front of the apartment, and knocked on the door. The door opened, and I was introduced to everyone by their nicknames. I met &amp;#8220;TowerT&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Twitch&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Hitcher&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Firefly&amp;#8221;, among others. I said that my nickname was &amp;#8220;Herbal&amp;#8221;, which was my rapping name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went around the room and did introductions. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure my face turned red &amp;#8211; I was so shy and afraid of public speaking that I was nervous talking about myself in front of 8 guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a knock on the door &amp;#8211; someone had arrived late. The door opened to reveal none other than one of my best friends, Hayden. We stared at each other, guilty and stunned. He was so flipped out that he walked back outside. I had to explain to the rest of the group what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that he had been studying this stuff for a few months, but also out of shame had kept it from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got over it, and the meeting continued. I whispered to him &amp;#8220;Watch. I&amp;#8217;m going to take this game over.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it came time to go downtown &amp;#8211; a totally foreign land to me. However, I was eager to show off what I had learned in front of Hayden. He was also eager to show me the ropes. The group took separate cars and agreed to meet at a bar called &amp;#8220;Spill&amp;#8221; and then move on from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Spill, Hayden and others were already there. Immediately, Hayden asked, &amp;#8220;Are you ready for your first set?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set is a group of people, including at least one girl, that you approach and talk to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Umm&amp;#8230;. no. We&amp;#8217;re just meeting here. We&amp;#8217;re going to pick up at another bar.&amp;#8221; As I said it, I knew what a lame excuse it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Come on. There&amp;#8217;s two girls right there. Let&amp;#8217;s go&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8230; can&amp;#8217;t.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my astonishment, he walked right up them and engaged them in conversation. To many of you this will sound like a simple task, but it shattered my reality at the moment. Before I had a chance to let it sink in, Hayden motioned towards me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Him, right there!&amp;#8221; he said. He was pulling me into the set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reluctantly I joined the conversation. It was strained at first, but eventually the topic shifted to rap and I was able to contribute. I teased the girls, as I&amp;#8217;d learned to do, and they responded. Neither was particularly attractive or interesting, but it felt good to be pushing my comfort zone. Hitcher, slightly inebriated, whispered in my ear &amp;#8220;DUDE! She&amp;#8217;s into you. Get her NUMBER.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure she heard him, but I still managed to stammer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Umm&amp;#8230; we should hang out some time. What&amp;#8217;s your number?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gave it to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe it. I walked up to some random girl in some random bar and left with her number. It was like the movies, or at least to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks we continued to go out. I was too scared to call the numbers I got, but I got a handful of them. But what really caught my attention is what people were posting online. They were getting numbers &amp;#8211; and more &amp;#8211; from models. I saw the pictures too&amp;#8230; some were perfect 10s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get good at anything, the best way is to go to the top. Learn from the experts. That year there had been a small convention where the top pick up artists (as they called themselves) met in Boston to compare notes and prove their skill. I decided that I would host the next one in Austin, figuring that this would ensure me access to the best teachers, without having to pay the hundreds of dollars per night that they charged for instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a seminar being held later that month in Chicago. It was sold out, but I wasn&amp;#8217;t interested in the seminar anyway. I just wanted to meet the famous pick up artists and see if they were really as good as they claimed, so I bought a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened there changed my life forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;That girl who I accused of having the chain DID steal it. Even though I suspected her, I was shocked. What a bitch. Anyway, she is giving it back. But&amp;#8230; I wanted to wear the chain for Krunkeoke last night, so I bought a new one. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonah and I are going to get on the Amazing Race. The only problem is that we just got the idea yesterday and our videos and applications need to be in by tomorrow. Based on what we&amp;#8217;ve worked out so far, and our stellar personalities, I don&amp;#8217;t see how it could even be possible that we WOULDN&amp;#8217;T get on the show.
&lt;p&gt;Also, I can&amp;#8217;t imagine how we wouldn&amp;#8217;t win. I plan on running every day, lifting weights every other day, and learning 1-2 more languages by the time the show films in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve got some killer stories coming up soon here, so Bookmark this bad boy now. Included are :
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it&amp;#8217;s Like Living With Courtney Love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Road Tripping in a 40 foot School Bus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accidentally Exploring the Longest Cave in America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Many People Should Drop Out of School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Secret Tunnels under UT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh, and for people interested in the polynapping &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s going great. I&amp;#8217;ve had two days where I&amp;#8217;ve basically had 19-20 hours of productive time that I&amp;#8217;ve worked.&lt;/li&gt;

This has got to be one of my all time best stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday night I was talking to my good friend Jonah and was telling him about the show &amp;#8220;The Amazing Race&amp;#8220;, and how I wanted to apply this year. Jonah and I have gone on a lot of trips together and somehow don&amp;#8217;t grate on each other&amp;#8217;s nerves at all. I have a lot of respect for him and his abilities, so I thought he&amp;#8217;d be a perfect partner for The Amazing Race. For those of you who don&amp;#8217;t know about this tv-tastic gem, it&amp;#8217;s basically a race / scavenger hunt around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meandered to the application site, downloaded the application, and began to check out the requirements. Guess when the due date for the tape was? Friday at 5pm, which meant that we had one day to create a 3 minute video, fill out the two 11 page applications and get some passport sized photos taken. Not one to back down from a challenge due to complete lack of time, I convinced Jonah to get on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday morning I called Fedex and found that the latest dropoff time was 8:30pm at a place near my house. I came up with an idea for the movie, and Jonah and I began filling out the applications. It took longer than expected, but the applications fit well together to form a solid team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video I wanted to do called for two actors besides Jonah and I, a camera man, and an editor. So the calls began. Here&amp;#8217;s the cast :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span id="more-1340"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Milo and &lt;a href="http://www.ticeton.com"&gt;Todd&lt;/a&gt; were my first two choices for the actors. Forgetting that he was one of my few friends (the only one?) who actually has a day job, I called Milo first. He was at work, but agreed to help out during his lunch hour of 12-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called Todd, but he was going to lunch. He said he&amp;#8217;d be available at 12:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted Hayden to do the camera, and he was available from 11am-2pm if we could pick him up and bring him back to class by 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry also agreed to do the camera, but no one knew when he&amp;#8217;d wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devon agreed to edit after 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needed a track, so we agreed on the high school near Milo&amp;#8217;s work because he was on the tightest schedule. Unfortunately, Milo works about 20 minutes from everyone. That meant that under the best conditions, we&amp;#8217;d have about 10 minutes to film the whole thing. And I had to write a few lines of a song by the time I got there. I loaded up my MP3 player with the beat  I was going to use, and headed to the high school. Jonah went to pick up Hayden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="img"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tynan directing" class="left" src="http://old.tynan.com/direct.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just so happened that there was lots of traffic during lunch hour, so we finally got everyone there by 1pm. Just as we got there, the track team started congregating on the field. This isn&amp;#8217;t good &amp;#8211; we needed to have the track alone, and I figured it was very likely that we&amp;#8217;d get kicked out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the team, we filmed two quick takes while the team warmed up on the field. Milo had to go back to work, but I was happy with the results anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we needed a location to film the &amp;#8220;interview&amp;#8221; portion of the video. I wanted a long hall that Jonah and I could walk down while being filmed. My first choice was the Erwin Center at UT. It&amp;#8217;s a circular arena with a long circular hallway around it&amp;#8217;s perimeter. I figured we could walk around it perpetually. My second choice was some part of the football stadium at UT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry woke up, so we picked him up and headed to the Erwin Center. After checking at least 40 locked doors, we gave up and moved on to the stadium. Despite my best efforts to negotiate with the powerless secretary whose boss was out on lunch, I couldn&amp;#8217;t get us access to the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s when it hit me that we may not get this thing finished. It was closing in on 3:30pm, giving us only 5 hours until our completed package had to be mailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued to walk, burdened by our video equipment (borrowed from Devon) and my new chain. We hit the concert halls and found all of them locked. Until&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a side door that led us into a perfect 150 seat empty auditorium. I took a seat on the stage to get ready for the interview, but immediately recognized that sitting in the green audience seats would look much better on camera. Jonah had the idea of switching positions and fading the cuts for a cool effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recorded 15 minutes of non scripted banter between Jonah and I, moving positions every 3 minutes or so. Now 4:30, we couldn&amp;#8217;t afford any more time. We had our doubts that the audio was loud enough, but there was no time to try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devon was picked up, and the four of us headed back to my house to edit. We hit rush hour traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally arriving home, we set about the task of getting the video from the camera to the computer. We hadn&amp;#8217;t even had the time to consider these logistics. I had a fast new computer that Terry quickly set up at my breakfast table. However, it had no drivers for the firewire port, so it was useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My laptop was the only computer that had firewire on it, so we logged the footage onto the hard drive using Microsoft&amp;#8217;s video editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that my laptop is a 2lb. sub compact which is completely unsuitable for editing. I tried every extra hard drive I had in my external enclosure, but for some reason NONE of them would work. I started to panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonah and Terry began crimping a crossover cable to connect the laptop directly to the new fast machine. It took a while, but when we hooked up the laptop, neither computer could see the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stole a different crossover cable from my network and used it to  connect the laptop to my other desktop computer &amp;#8211; nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put the crossover cable back, unplugged my printer from the network and used that cable to plug into the laptop. Finally, that worked and we got the video (slowly) to my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem was that I still needed to use that computer to make the song I was going to use as the soundtrack for the video. We could deal with that later, though. 6:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonah and I drove to get our passport photos taken. It was a rip off at $35 for the worst photos I&amp;#8217;d ever seen (the guy was very unclear on why I wanted to wear my chain in my passport photos), but there was no time for retakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we returned at 7:00, significant progress had been made on editing, but we realized that we forgot to pick up the VCR from Devon&amp;#8217;s house, which was necessary because CBS is in the stone ages and won&amp;#8217;t accept a DVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonah and Terry left to retrieve the VCR while Devon and I finished the edits. By 7:50 we were nearing completion of the edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s when I realized three things :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I still hadn&amp;#8217;t filled out my application (I had just typed up my answers on a separate page)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The audio was inaudible in the beginning part and needed to be dubbed over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. We had no VHS tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked on my application until Devon said we needed the overdubs and song. I sent him to get the VHS tape while I did the overdubs. They sounded good on the first try, although we still needed Jonah to do his. I cranked out the song in the first try and exported it to mp3 for Devon. I went back to filling out my applicatoin and Devon returned and started putting the audio in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jonah and Terry got back it was 8:05, and we neeeded to leave. I ran into the computer room with Jonah, did his dubs, and yelled to Terry to finish my application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 8:10 we were ready&amp;#8230; when we realized something. The only way to get the video to the VCR was through the camera. And the camera needed firewire, which was only on my laptop &amp;#8211; where the video wasn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was ready to give up, except for me. I was really psyched about this show and was not going to give up. I yelled out, &amp;#8220;I have an inverter. We have 20 minutes to get there &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;ll figure it out in the car&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry ran to the car, set up the VCR, started the car, and put the address for Fedex in the GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I yelled to Jonah to drive to Fedex and stall them, and he was off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copied Premeire over to the laptop along with the video files, and bolted out the door with the laptop. Devon grabbed the cables for the camera. When we pulled out of the driveway, the GPS said our Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) was 8:30 on the dot. It&amp;#8217;s usually accurate within a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last minute check revealed that we had forgotten the camera. I bolted back to the house, and got the camera &amp;#8211; along with the application forms and blank tape that we had forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumping back into the car, I took off. Now&amp;#8230; my car has expired registration, the title isn&amp;#8217;t in my name, it is not inspected, and I had my gun in the car but forgot my wallet which had my license and permit. Let&amp;#8217;s just say that getting pulled over was not an option. If a cop started chasing me, I was going to just have him follow me all the way to fedex and explain there. Again&amp;#8230; refer to the decision making chart in the Penguin story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hit the highway at 85 and Devon started doing the final render of the video. It took 5-6 minutes and several reboots. That&amp;#8217;s when he reported that Premiere was broken and wouldn&amp;#8217;t output to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He kept trying to mess with the camera and Premeire, but nothing was working. Jonah called and told us that he couldn&amp;#8217;t find Fedex. Through aggressive driving I managed to get the GPS&amp;#8217;s ETA down to only 8:28, but a wrong turn bumped it back up to 8:31. At one point I was on the phone, trying to help Devon diagnose the problem, and weaving in and out of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Fedex at 8:31 and they were closed. We sat in defeat for a few minutes, trying to get the attention of an employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just then Jonah called. His dad knew of another fedex 25 minutes away. That gave us one minute to spare, but still no video to mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On blind faith, I stamped the gas pedal and raced for the other Fedex. Jonah knew where that one was and headed there as well. Devon continued to battle with Premeire, but couldn&amp;#8217;t figure it out. He managed to get the video to play on the camera, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t record to tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the other Fedex at 8:59. I raced in, and upon receiving the information that they were still open, yelled to Terry and Devon. I found a socket in the wall, they brought the laptop, camera, and VCR in, and we got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s when I had a great idea &amp;#8211; export the video from Premeire as an AVI, open it in Microsoft&amp;#8217;s video program, and use that to export back to the camera. The 12 minute export procedure began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I engaged in a conversation with the Fedex Employee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s going on?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We need to get on the show The Amazing Race. We have had the worst luck getting this to work, and this is our last chance&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What can I do to help?&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Just be as patient with us as you&amp;#8217;re allowed to be&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll do what I can, but the last truck is on it&amp;#8217;s way, and when it&amp;#8217;s here there&amp;#8217;s nothing I can do&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video FINALLY finished rendering and we imported it into the Microsoft program. As Devon had predicted, there was no way to export from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now even I was ready to give up. There was no way it was going to happen. I declared that it was over, but the employee said &amp;#8220;The truck is loading now. You still have 5 minutes&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me &amp;#8211; if there was video on the screen of the camcorder, there was a chance that that same video was being outputted through the camera&amp;#8217;s outputs. Maybe we didn&amp;#8217;t even need to record to the camera first. Devon agreed it might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there was a problem &amp;#8211; we had no TV and thus no way to tell if the VCR was getting the input or not. We decided that we may as well try. and send the tape off with some blind faith. We pressed play and begin the process. A minute into the video, it became choppy and stopped. We tried again&amp;#8230; choppy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was again declared a lost cause when I had ANOTHER idea &amp;#8211; what if we just opened the version we rendered for Microsoft&amp;#8217;s program in Premiere, and then tried to play that through the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did it, hit record and hit play. If it was choppy this time, it was too late. If it wasn&amp;#8217;t, we MIGHT make it. We all held our breath as it played. It hit the mark where it was choppy before and played flawlessly. This was the first time we&amp;#8217;d even watched the video &amp;#8211; we had no time to preview it. It was good. Much better than we anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The truck is about to leave,&amp;#8221; said the employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched our superfluous ending sequence with a grimace. The truck driver came into the main office &amp;#8220;Alright&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m out of here,&amp;#8221; he said to our employee friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s one more.&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video finished. Devon pressed stop, ejected the tape, and threw it into our envelope. We handed the package to the driver with NO time to spare. I truly believe if we finished 20 seconds later, we would not have gotten it on the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re ready to watch our masterpiece, put some socks on and check out &lt;a href="http://www.tynan.com/amazing_web.avi"&gt;our video application for The Amazing Race.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got home, starving and tired (I had skipped three naps that day and all meals) and recreated the setup to test if the video had actually outputted or not. We hit play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that there was nothing on the video camera screen either. Devon secured the cable and hit play again. After a quick pause the video played flawlessly. We rejoiced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/the-amazing-race-for-the-amazing-race/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/the-amazing-race-for-the-amazing-race/#comments</comments><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2006 07:54:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Drop Out and Grow Rich</title><link>https://tynan.com/drop-out-and-grow-rich/</link><description>In our culture going to school is given a lot of respect.

Dropouts face a sharp negative stigma. They&amp;#8217;re quitters. They&amp;#8217;re losers. They&amp;#8217;ll go nowhere in life. But is this really true? How big of a factor is college on success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a list of some of the dropouts that I personally admire :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates&lt;br /&gt;
Steve Jobs&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Allen&lt;br /&gt;
Richard Branson&lt;br /&gt;
Larry Ellison (Oracle)&lt;br /&gt;
Dave Thomas&lt;br /&gt;
Ted Turner&lt;br /&gt;
Henry Ford&lt;br /&gt;
Almost 1 in 5 of the US Presidents including Lincoln, Washington, Jackson, and Cleveland&lt;br /&gt;
Albert Einstein&lt;br /&gt;
Walt Disney&lt;br /&gt;
John D. Rockafeller&lt;br /&gt;
Mark Twain&lt;br /&gt;
Charles Dickens&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas Edison&lt;br /&gt;
Benjamin Franklin&lt;br /&gt;
Ray Kroc (billionaire founder of McDonalds)&lt;br /&gt;
Claude Monet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every one of those people dropped out of school before graduating college. They account for 4 out of 5 of the richest people in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does college really get you anyway? For one, it&amp;#8217;s a lot of fun. I basically considered it to be like summer camp. I got to live close to a lot of cool people with few obligations (other than class, which interfered occasionally). It&amp;#8217;s also a sheep herding school. It teaches people to be obedient and subservient &amp;#8211; deadlines are the biggest priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two distinctions I want to make. First is that there are some professions where college is not only helpful, but is necessary. You can&amp;#8217;t become a doctor, a lawyer, or an investment banker without schooling. So if your passion is for one of those professions, I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting you drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other distinction I need to make is that &amp;#8220;College&amp;#8221; is not equal to &amp;#8220;Learning&amp;#8221;. It can be, but isn&amp;#8217;t by necessity. You&amp;#8217;d be hard pressed to find a successful individual who isn&amp;#8217;t obsessed with learning. Knowledge IS power, but school isn&amp;#8217;t the best vehicle for that knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, going to school can&amp;#8217;t hurt, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WRONG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs are harmed by going to school. It conforms views and does not at all reward individuality or thinking outside of the box &amp;#8211; two essential traits for entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People generally go to school from ages 18-22, or even longer. These are PRIME years. When you&amp;#8217;re young you have the luxury of taking risks. You have few responsibilities, so if you go bust you can start over easily enough. Once you grow older and have a spouse and children, you may not have that luxury. College steals some of our most valuable years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College-mongers just LOVE the statistics, don&amp;#8217;t they? So do I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the college-mongers, an average person with a Bachelor&amp;#8217;s degree will earn 900k more in a lifetime than someone who never attended high school. First of all, I believe this is faulty logic because it&amp;#8217;s considering all the people who couldn&amp;#8217;t possibly get into school (most likely because they don&amp;#8217;t have a high level of capability). This article is intended for those who have the choice. But&amp;#8230; let&amp;#8217;s go with it anyway, since it&amp;#8217;s the closest statistic I can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did the math on what a college education REALLY costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here were my assumptions :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the College Board, tution prices for 2005-2006 are:
&lt;p&gt;Private School &amp;#8211; $21,235 (rising at a rate of 5.9% annually)&lt;br /&gt;
Public School &amp;#8211; $5,491 (rising at a rate of 7.1% annually)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to historic prices, the average return on stock investments were 11% annually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious to see what would happen if the enterprising 18 year old decided to invest his money rather than spend it on college. Would he be able to close the 900k lifetime gap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an excel spreadsheet and plotted it out to retirement age of 64. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual considering private school made up the 900k difference by the age of 41. If he waited until he was 64, his tuition would have turned into 10.7mil. For you college-monger stat people, that&amp;#8217;s almost 12 times the earnings gap. Notably, he&amp;#8217;d be able to live pretty nicely off his nearly $1.2mil in interest he&amp;#8217;d earn yearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the public school hopeful? Surely he couldn&amp;#8217;t make up almost a million dollars in less wages, could he? Of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could reach 900k and retire ten years early at 54 and enjoy the average 108k in yearly interest for the rest of his life. If he waited until 64, his tuition money would have turned into over 2.8million, leaving him with 300k in yearly interest to scrape by on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I took it a step further &amp;#8211; Would a college goer EVER have more money saved than someone who didn&amp;#8217;t go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average college graduate earns $45,400 their first year out of college. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average high school graduate earns only $25,900 their first year out of high school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be more than fair I assumed two things. First, that the high school graduate spends 100% of his income on living expenses. Second, that the college graduate spends exactly as much as the high school graduate. In reality it would be a lot more, but I wanted to simulate them each having an equal standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I increased both salaries by 3% per year to account for inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened? The high school graduate who saved private school level money ALWAYS had more money than the college graduate, by at least $220k. The college graduate saved less than 1.3mil by retirement, only 12% of the high school grad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college graduate fared better against the high school graduate who only saved public school level tuition. By age 32, college graduate had reached the amount saved by the high school graduate. However, by age 50, the high school graduate was back in the lead and remained there. At retirement age he had more than twice what the college graduate had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean? It means that you need to THINK FOR YOURSELF (or follow my flow chart and let me do it for you), rather than assuming college is the right move. Personally, dropping out of college was the best move I ever made. My friend &lt;a href="http://www.colorblindlighting.com"&gt;Phil&lt;/a&gt; has a successful business and a very happy life. My friend Elisia runs &lt;a href="http://www.kittyradio.com"&gt;KittyRadio&lt;/a&gt; among other businesses, and is very happy and successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless going to college is going to teach you specific skills that you will need to follow out your passion in life, it is very likely that not going is a better option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="-1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tynan.com/dropornot.xls"&gt;The spreadsheet I created for this article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/drop-out-and-grow-rich/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/drop-out-and-grow-rich/#comments</comments><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2006 10:20:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Drop Out and Grow Rich : The Remix</title><link>https://tynan.com/drop-out-and-grow-rich-the-remix/</link><description>A bunch of people e-mailed me about the Drop Out and Grow Rich article I posted yesterday.

A friend of mine pointed out a few things, most importantly that I failed to give the college grad interest on his money. Fixing that (and making him pay interest if he was negative, but only after the first 4 years of college) put him very close to the high school grad with private school money. Never charging him interest for being negative got him slightly above that same person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was pointed out that the difference in earnings wasn&amp;#8217;t 900k as the college-mongers claimed. It was more like 1.3mil. I had no good data on salary increases, so I assumed the inflation rate. I guess it stands to reason that after a while job experience means more than the degree, so the gap gets smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I fudged the grad&amp;#8217;s income to equal a 900k lifetime earnings difference, the Dropout with Private School money is again the winner, but is still followed closely by the grad. If I fudge the dropout&amp;#8217;s starting income (to $29,692) to get the 900k difference, the grad still beats the dropout with public level money, but only by 300k. Also, the dropout would be beating him until age 58.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People also pointed out that college loans and such reduce the cost of school, and that most people who don&amp;#8217;t go to college aren&amp;#8217;t going to have 22k a year to play with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this all mean? Mainly that the experiment is flawed. It&amp;#8217;s impossible to get accurate data. I was trying to get more and more info to make it more and more accurate, but there are too many conflicting sources. There are also far too many individual factors to make this an accurate representation of YOUR experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I wrote the article was to get people thinking, and to realize that college is not NECESSARILY going to get you more money. The 900k figure always bothered me because it makes it seem like college is a guaranteed ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in truth, I think everyone should go to college for a year or two. It&amp;#8217;s a fun time and is an important experience. Not the school, but the social life. I had some of the best times in my life there, and I&amp;#8217;m very glad I went for a year and a half. I&amp;#8217;m also very glad I dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What prompted me to write the article is that I see a lot of people who have no intention of even using their degree for a profession. They stay in because of parents, apathy, or because it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;the thing to do&amp;#8221;. I also see a lot of budding entrepreneurs who are just waiting to get out of college and have no interest of ever getting a real job. I firmly believe that all of those people should drop out immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you don&amp;#8217;t want to be an entrepreneur and are still trying to figure out what you want to do, staying in school is probably a better idea. It&amp;#8217;s easy to get exposed to a lot of different subjects there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in school, I was there because it was very important to my parents that I stay in. No one in my father&amp;#8217;s family had ever gone to a four year university until his generation. The same was true of my mother&amp;#8217;s family. My mother was the first in her family to go to college, and she had gone to Columbia. Her parents were very poor when they were young, but they worked very hard and built their own business (after working up to four jobs at a time) which was very successful. Rather than amass their money and distribute it when they died, they invested a portion of it for every child in the family when he was born. That money was intended to pay for college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother&amp;#8217;s dream was for her children to go to college. After Columbia she went back to school at UT to get a Master&amp;#8217;s degree. Needless to say, education was very important to her. When I called her to tell her that I was dropping out of school, she was FURIOUS. I knew this was the case, and was the main thing holding me back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I knew I had to drop out &amp;#8211; I would have considered myself a huge failure if I ended up at a typical 9-5 job. I wasn&amp;#8217;t learning anything that would help me with my own business, and I just didn&amp;#8217;t like doing the work. I felt like it was a waste of time for me to do most of it, so often times I would refuse to complete assignments or study for tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two months my mother barely spoke to or acknowledged me. I hated hurting her, but I knew that it was what was best for me, and that ultimately that&amp;#8217;s what she really wanted. As time went on she started talking to me&amp;#8230; mainly along the lines of &amp;#8220;When are you going back to school?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that now our relationship is better than ever. All of the arguments over school, report cards, and majors are gone. She&amp;#8217;s seen that I can support myself without a degree, and that I really am very happy. My parents even let me use their house as collateral when I bought my house &amp;#8211; a testament to their faith in me now that I&amp;#8217;ve proved myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandparents were also understanding &amp;#8211; I was worried they&amp;#8217;d be angry I used the money they gave me for business, but they were very supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So take a look at your situation. What benefits is your degree going to get you? Why are you in school? What would you do if you weren&amp;#8217;t in school? Money is important, but what&amp;#8217;s most important is your happiness. Which will lead to greater happiness down the line?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/drop-out-and-grow-rich-the-remix/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/drop-out-and-grow-rich-the-remix/#comments</comments><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2006 09:28:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Everything I’ve 3D Printed</title><link>https://tynan.com/3dprint/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="1000" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wp-16449682951412570433570633441444-768x1024.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 133.33%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="750" /&gt;The thing about a 3D printer is that buying one and learning to use it can rarely be justified by just one project.

&lt;p&gt;The thing about a 3D printer is that buying one and learning to use it can rarely be justified by just one project. In fact, what makes it most valuable is that it can do dozens of tiny projects that could essentially not be done in any other way. And while you may think that you can imagine what you would use a 3D printer for, you really don’t have any idea until you actually get one and have printing 3D parts in your toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, I thought it would be fun to dig through my CAD directory and explain every single thing I designed and printed. I also printed some things that other people designed, but I won’t include those.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re considering getting into 3D printing, my strongest recommendation is to buy a Prusa. I bought the cheapest “good” 3D printer I could find. It printed pretty well out of the box, but it was extremely loud so I started trying to make it quieter by upgrading parts. That made it print poorly, so I started upgrading components of it, which made it oscillate between printing really well and really poorly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end I was left with a 3D printer that cost me more than the gold standard, a Prusa i3 MKS, and printed much more poorly. This caused me to go for about six months without printing anything because the process was just too annoying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I finally caved and bought the Prusa (and made the horrific mistake of not buying it pre-assembled, which meant I spent 8 hours building it to save $200), and ever since printing has been a dream. Everything prints perfectly with no effort, even though I now only print in PETG (a better but much more finicky material).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the things I’ve designed and printed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LED Candle housing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-3628" height="768" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/20200409_005723-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;the main reason I bought a 3D printer in the first place was because lockdowns hit, I’d always wanted a 3D printer, and I felt like I had the time to learn how to use one. The main thing I wanted to fabricate were 3D housings for a very realistic LED candle that I designed and programmed. I eventually hit the limitations of my printer and got frustrated and stopped the project, but I have a new printer and will probably get back to it once I have some time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Incense Burner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/53/8f/00/36/85/featured_preview_signal-2021-11-09-071625_001.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think this might be the most genius thing I ever came up with. I had a stick of incense and couldn’t find a little burner, so I 3D printed one I downloaded. The little stump of the stick got stuck in the hole, which made me think that there must be some way to design an incense burner to automatically eject the stump when it was done. I came up with an idea that used gravity and made almost 30 iterations. It now works perfectly and I use it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone should steal my idea and produce this commercially because it’s better than other designs and then I could buy one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I uploaded the files for this &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5113953"&gt;on Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coupler Replacement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I went on a tear of trying to upgrade my 3D printer and in the process I broke a piece of it, which caused it to create really crappy prints. Since it would still print poorly I had the idea of measuring the part, recreating it in 3D, printing it, and putting it back in the machine. I did that and it worked, which enabled me to print a higher quality one and replace the poorly printed one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tablet Mount&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wanted to have a tablet as the interface for my 3D printer so I designed a pretty simple tablet mount to hold the tablet at the correct angle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teforia Funnel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every time I filled my &lt;a href="http://tynan.com/teforia"&gt;Teforia&lt;/a&gt; (RIP) I would spill tea leaves everywhere. I measured the aperture of the brewing chamber and made a little funnel to help guide the tea in. Used it every day until the Teforia died and printed them out for other friends who had Teforias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shotoku Glass Holders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I put shallow metal shelves up in my kitchen to hold tea and glasses, but it annoyed me that my glasses weren’t evenly spaced and made noise when rubbing against the metal. I designed a spacing system for the shelves but then realized my printer bed wasn’t big enough to really do it properly and I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tea Caddies for Snow Peak Kanpai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.sett.com/images/user/20201205/IMG5186ad7bc91da7560ca5adf163ef1d24045e.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point I bought just about every stackable cylindrical container set on Amazon to try to find one to fit inside my water thermos to store tea. The one I ended up with was ok but clearly didn’t use all the space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I spent a few days and designed my own that uses about 95+% of the available space. It holds nearly twice the tea, fits much more snugly, and my &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5113549"&gt;newest version&lt;/a&gt; (made recently) has embedded NFC chips to tell me what is in each one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was one of my favorite projects since I had to learn how to create screw threads and the result is something I use every day when I travel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaire Lid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-3630" height="768" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/20200725_201715-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In studying Urasenke tea ceremony I wanted to learn how to do thick tea, or Koicha, ceremony. This requires a chaire, which is a fancy Japanese matcha tea holder. My teacher loaned me one but it didn’t have a lid, so I measured it and designed a lid for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mounts for Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I got motivated to start organizing my closet and desk better, so I made some hanging mounts for things like my router, USB dock, power supplies, etc. This is a good example of something that is much better when it’s custom fit to the component, but there’s no other way to get it&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jig for Wood Slat Walls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wanted to build a decorative wood slat wall that would use 70 or so vertical slats, but didn’t want to have to measure and mark all of them. So I built a little jig that would butt against the previous slat and hold the new one in place to be nailed in. It worked ok, but in retrospect I should have measured every 5 or 10 because I got a slight error on one end by the time I hit the other wall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shelf Bracket&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-3631" height="1024" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wp-16449715681648202093625312834439-768x1024.jpg" width="768" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My tea room was formerly a bar, and it had a small shelf section with glass shelves held by white metal brackets. I measured the glass and had another piece cut to make a new shelf but for the life of me I couldn’t find any brackets that looked like the shelf brackets. Then I realized that I could just measure them and 3D print white plastic ones that would look exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mailbox Spacer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I got a metal mailbox that I really liked, but my wife hated it because sometimes if she or the mailman pulled the door too hard it would come out. She wanted me to return it but instead I came up with a way to make two locking plugs that I could push in and prevent the door from falling out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall Box Cover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I moved a light fixture and wanted to cover the old wall box, but our house is old and all of the covers were the wrong size. Finally I realized I could just 3D print one that would fit perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot Tub Grate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-3629" height="1024" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wp-16449709315907097509012953421050-768x1024.jpg" width="768" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I bought a used hot tub on Craigslist and there was a clear plastic piece that separated the tub from the filter area. It cracked in half and exposed the filter, so I measured it and 3D printed my own.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roof Angle Jig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My first slatted wall divider came out great so I decided to make another one in a different room. Unfortunately this one butted up against an angled ceiling. After trying to figure out how I was going to cut a precise angle into a long piece of wood I realized I could just print mounting brackets that would screw into the angled ceiling and provide a level cradle for the wood. They came out great but in the end weren’t really needed because the angle was so slight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dryer Vent Spacer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most annoying thing about our house is that the dryer didn’t have a vent outside. I bought an indoor vent filter, but it was annoying to clean and added a lot of heat in the summer. Finally one day I braved the dusty attic crawl space and found a path for a duct, drilled a hole in the side of the house, and ran the duct. The only problem? The flange in the laundry room was too tall and pushed against some HVAC equipment. I was stumped at first, but then realized I could make a spacer to pull the flange more into the laundry room. The dimensions and color are the same as the flange so it looks like it’s part of it. In retrospect I could have also just made a much better flange.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadbolt Hole Cover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sort of like the wall box cover, I removed a pointless deadbolt on a closet, which left a hole there. I didn’t like any of the expensive covers on Amazon so I just designed my own. I am slightly worried that my house is becoming more and more made of 3D plastic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this post gives you an idea of the ways that having a 3D printer can solve little everyday problems. I use FreeCAD to design things, which I understand isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as good as the options available for Windows, but it does well enough for my little prints. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photo is a random photo of my 3D printer that I found. I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about cool things you&amp;#8217;ve designed and printed in 3D, too. Leave them in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/3dprint/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/3dprint/#comments</comments><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Hockey is The Best Sport</title><link>https://tynan.com/hockey/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="563" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/wp-1647847446498-1024x768.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 75%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="750" /&gt;It started during the Stanley Cup playoffs of last year.

&lt;p&gt;It started during the Stanley Cup playoffs of last year. Las Vegas has a team called the Vegas Golden Knights, who have generally done very well since becoming a team five years ago. My friend Lucas, who recently moved to Vegas, asked if I wanted to go to one of the playoff games. I said sure, and then backpedaled once I found out that bad tickets were $250 each.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He got tickets for him and his girlfriend instead, but when she backed out last minute he offered me her ticket.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The game was incredible! I have a vague recollection of going to a hockey game or two as a kid, and I think I maybe even went to hockey class or something, but watching it was much more fun than I could have expected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, I cared if a sports team won. At every logical level I can think of, it is totally idiotic to care. None of the players are actually from Vegas, and only one is even from the United States. Whether or not they win will have no bearing whatsoever in my life, and none of the players could care less about anything I do. And yet&amp;#8230; I was leaping to my feet every time they scored a goal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend bailed on the next game. And the one after that, too. I went to three playoff games in a row and was totally hooked. I thanked her for being so flaky and she said, “Oh, he told you I was going to go? I said no.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To pay him back, I bought tickets for the next game. But his home team, the Canadiens, were playing and the previous beating they took was depressing for him, so he declined. Left with a couple hours before the game and an extra ticket, I asked my wife if she wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She would normally be the absolute last person I’d invite to a sports game of any sort because she has never shown any interest in any sport, but I had no other good choices. I told her how surprised I was at how much fun hockey was, and so she reluctantly said yes. I think she mostly went because she likes going out on dates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the game I could see that she was getting into it and was surprised. Afterwards I asked her how much she’d pay to go to another game. It’s worth mentioning that I’m pretty frugal, but she is much more frugal. She drives to Chipotle to pick up my orders sometimes because she doesn’t want me to waste money on the delivery fee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said she’d pay $200 per ticket. I was shocked. I don’t think she’d ever paid that much to go to any event ever.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We went to all of the rest of the playoff games that year. Then when the next season started we went to every preseason and regular season game that we were both in town for. If I’m in Vegas alone, I go to the game by myself. Once I bought only one ticket because she wasn’t going to be in town, but she managed to make it back last minute. She bought her own ticket on the other side of the arena so that she could go too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I say all this to emphasize just how much fun it is to go to hockey games, even if you don’t care at all about hockey. I’ve gotten a bunch of other friends to go, and in every case they’ve gone to every subsequent game they were able to make it to. It is an absolute blast. I even wear a gold sequinned jacket to match the team colors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we went to the playoffs, we consistently sat in the highest seats. I actually think they’re some of the best seats for watching the action, but they’re not considered great seats. A few weeks later we got the opportunity to go to an NBA playoff game in a luxury box with actual NBA players. It was an incredible experience, but the game itself was a lot less fun than a preseason NHL game from the nosebleeds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s great about hockey is that the game is very easy to understand. Just get the puck into the other net. There are two other things you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, you can’t just dump the puck way into the other end to get it out of your zone. That’s called icing. If someone does that, the puck comes back near their net for a face-off. You also can&amp;#8217;t cross the blue line into the opposing team&amp;#8217;s side if any members of your team are already over there. If you do, it’s called offsides. As long as you know those two things, pretty much everything will make sense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of what makes hockey so amazing is that teams can basically do whatever they want. Is the game almost over and you’re down a goal and need more offense? You can get rid of your goalie and replace him with some other random player. Want to fight someone on the other team? Just start swinging and all of a sudden the TV commentators turn into boxing analysts. You’ll get a penalty, but so will the other guy and they won’t actually reduce the number of players on the ice, so it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Know what you can’t do? You can’t fall and pretend you were hurt like they do in soccer or basketball. If you do that it’s called embellishing, and YOU get sent to the penalty box. Brutal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The game is also very beautiful. The players skate gracefully like birds in formation. Each point matters, so the game is always interesting. A 3-1 game is MUCH different than a 3-2 game, so getting that goal is really exciting. Goalies are incredible freaks of nature who can snap pucks out of the air even with five people blocking their view. Even without understanding the intricacies of the game, the performance is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you live in a city that has hockey, go to a game! All arenas are different, but my favorite place to sit is anywhere between the blue lines as far forward on the upper level as possible. I have also sat 10 rows back from the ice dead center and front row near an end, but sitting high and center makes it really easy and fun to follow the game. I usually go have dinner somewhere near the arena and buy a ticket while I’m eating dinner since prices drop right before the game starts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if you’ve been to hockey games and somehow don’t enjoy them, a big takeaway I got from this experience is that the EV of trying new things is extremely high. If I didn’t enjoy my first hockey game, life could have gone on as normal, but now my friends and I go to every game we can, I plan my travel around home games, and my wife and I have a new hobby together. I&amp;#8217;ve even started ice skating as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photo is probably the &amp;#8220;best&amp;#8221; seats I&amp;#8217;ve had at a hockey game, but honestly sitting higher up is a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience having covid wasn&amp;#8217;t bad at all and I feel like I have no lasting effects, but all of the recent articles about how covid affects one&amp;#8217;s brain long-term made me wonder whether or not it affected me. Maybe I had become dumber, but didn&amp;#8217;t realize it!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I thought about ways that I could verify this, it occured to me that my cousin and I send each other our crossword scores nearly every single day. Because of how much sleep affects my ability to complete crosswords, I figured it might be a good proxy for mental ability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, I downloaded a program to extract all of my text messages into a readable data format. I then made a simple program to go through every message and extract the time (mm:ss) if there was one in the message. Using the timestamp of when it was sent, I tried to guess which day the crossword was for (the next day&amp;#8217;s crosswords come out at 7pm on most days and 5pm on Sundays and Mondays), and I created a csv with that series.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had data from October 2019 until April 2022. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what happened to the older text messages, but I figured that would be good enough data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-3643" height="371" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Crossword-Scores.png" width="871" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt; I got covid on 9/10/2021, and as you can see from the graph above, it seems that my crossword performance did not suffer. In fact, my best average times ever were about 3 months later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My time trends have been going up recently, which could mean that there was some sort of delayed effect, but I think it coincides pretty exactly with when I became more interested in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://quordle.com"&gt;Quordle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://octordle.com"&gt;Octordle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://sedecordle.com/"&gt;Sedecordle&lt;/a&gt;. That led to me doing crosswords much later in the day, rather than when they first come out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If I were better at data analysis, I would adjust scores based on time of day and might also break them down by day of week. Monday through Wednesday are probably more about mental quickness, Thursday through Sunday are more about reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we first started doing crosswords, I would beat my cousin almost every day. After a few months she began to beat me on the monday through wednesdays, but I still won on the later days. Now she wins almost every single day. I probably haven&amp;#8217;t won in months, and when I do win it&amp;#8217;s by some tiny amount of time. She routinely beats me by several minutes!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but also analyze her times, and sure enough her average time is 6:53 seconds and mine is 9:14. She&amp;#8217;s beating me by over two minutes a day, which is pretty amazing when you consider than an average Monday time is about 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While I couldn&amp;#8217;t detect any covid related brain damage, that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that it hasn&amp;#8217;t happened. One paper said that people who had covid had lost brain matter in the areas related to taste and smell. I believe I can taste and smell as well as ever, but it&amp;#8217;s possible that I just can&amp;#8217;t remember what it used to be like. I also wouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised if drinking tea mindfully every day has helped me preserve those senses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Either way, it was fun to realize I had a way to figure out if I had become dumber due to covid and to go down the rabbit hole to actually analyze the data. If my brain was damaged, I&amp;#8217;m glad it&amp;#8217;s not the crossword part. I&amp;#8217;m already too far behind my cousin!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photo is from Munich, where I laid over for a day on the way to Budapest. I came here for a couple days to fix some banking issues&amp;#8230; only to realize that they celebrate Easter on Monday (my last day here), so I may have come for nothing. At least I&amp;#8217;ll get to go to an opera!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/covidbrain/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/covidbrain/#comments</comments><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2022 13:27:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Having Good Interactions With Store Employees</title><link>https://tynan.com/befriendly/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="1000" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wp-16529161497108823421636955730471-768x1024.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 133.33%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="750" /&gt;The other day I walked into Dandelion Chocolate.

&lt;p&gt;The other day I walked into &lt;a href="https://store.dandelionchocolate.com/pages/home"&gt;Dandelion Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;. There was a bit of a line, but the second barista, who wasn&amp;#8217;t taking orders, asked what drink I was going to have. Iced chocolate chai (seriously, try this thing), I said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She waved me up to the front, made my drink, and said, &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s on the house. I think you come here a lot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was only the second or third time I&amp;#8217;d been to that location, and she had never been there before when I was there. She did look familiar, though.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I found out that she used to be the manager at &lt;a href="http://samovartea.com"&gt;Samovar&lt;/a&gt;, which was my favorite tea house in the world for many years. I don&amp;#8217;t think that we had ever had a proper conversation, but we had certainly had a dozen or more small interactions. We hadn&amp;#8217;t seen each other in at least 6-7 years, though.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After over a year, Hawaii was finally open to visitors again. My first stop was &lt;a href="https://www.pokemarkethi.com/"&gt;Poke Market&lt;/a&gt; (best poke in the world). &amp;#8220;Hey! Haven&amp;#8217;t seen you in so long! Half brown rice half cabbage, yeah?&amp;#8221;. After poke I went to get shave ice at &lt;a href="https://kulashaveice.com/"&gt;Kula Shave Ice&lt;/a&gt; (best shave ice in the world). They didn&amp;#8217;t charge me for the Haupia coconut cream I get on top because they remembered me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I shy away from writing about social skills stuff because it feels like bragging. I think that comes from the ingrained idea that social skills are who we are, whereas other skills we might learn are just abilities we have developed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If I told you that I worked really hard to get good at tennis, I don&amp;#8217;t think it would feel braggy. But saying that people like me certainly does. It always amuses me that we treat something with &amp;#8220;skill&amp;#8221; in its name as if it&amp;#8217;s not a skill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is a skill, of course, and it&amp;#8217;s one that I used to not have at all. One thing I like about social skills is that it&amp;#8217;s largely the skill of making other people feel good. Who likes you? People who feel good around you. Who wants to talk to you? People who feel heard and valued when they talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How do you get the skill of having staff treat you well?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever you have any sort of interaction with any sort of staff, look them in the eyes, smile, and try to actually engage with them rather than reading lines off a script. This sounds so obvious and basic, but I&amp;#8217;m shocked at how few people do it. People treat waiters like they&amp;#8217;re Siri or Alexa. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll have hot chocolate, thanks,&amp;#8221; they&amp;#8217;ll say, without even making eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And hey, the person is being paid to take your order so you don&amp;#8217;t actually owe them any sort of kindness, but what a missed opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good interactions often start with gratitude. Nearly every time someone is waiting on me or taking my order I think about how incredibly fortunate I am that they&amp;#8217;re there. They had to wake up early, put on their work clothes, clock in, deal with their boss, and wait around in case I came in to order. All I had to do was mosey over and ask for whatever I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t take that for granted. We&amp;#8217;re so lucky to be in a society that functions well enough to have people to help us out with stuff. Most service staff receive very little gratitude for what they do. I say thank you, and mean it, every time they do anything for me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I try to be specific, too. To an Uber driver I might say, &amp;#8220;Hey, thanks so much for being up early enough to take us to the airport. We really appreciate it.&amp;#8221; To a flight attendant I&amp;#8217;ll say, &amp;#8220;Sorry for bugging you and asking for hot water all the time. I know you&amp;#8217;re busy and I really appreciate it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customer-facing employees often spend their whole days interacting with people but getting nothing out of it at all. How frustrating must that be? When they see that you&amp;#8217;re friendly and actually engaged, they&amp;#8217;ll sometimes see that as their only chance to have a real conversation all day. So even if it&amp;#8217;s not something you&amp;#8217;re all that interested in, being willing to listen can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you do all this, you&amp;#8217;ll get treated really well everywhere you go. But, equally importantly, you&amp;#8217;ll be treating people really well, too. In a world increasingly defined by impersonal connections, it&amp;#8217;s nice to be the outlier. Plus you might get free hot chocolate sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photo is from &lt;a href="https://tynan.com/formocha/"&gt;Formocha in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;. I came back after 7 years and the owner, Amanda, remembered me. She had us in for tea for 4 hours, made us lunch and literally baked us a cake from scratch while we were there, and sent us packing with amazing tea and refused to take any payment. I&amp;#8217;d like to take credit for that, but really the story there is that she&amp;#8217;s just incredibly kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re an investor in anything other than real estate, you&amp;#8217;re probably in the middle of a bear market right now. And if you&amp;#8217;re a real estate investor… these rising interest rates could mean choppy waters lie ahead. My largest investment by far is Ethereum, and it&amp;#8217;s down about 80% from its all time high, so you can imagine what that&amp;#8217;s done to my net worth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while I have an emotional preference for larger numbers over smaller ones, I have to admit that I&amp;#8217;m excited and feel good about what&amp;#8217;s going on. I wanted to write about why that is, hopefully help you feel better about it, and offer some practical ideas on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first thing to accept is that bear markets are actually a healthy part of the financial ecosystem, just like forest fires are good for forests. In the short term they can feel really bad, but in the long run they are what keep things healthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The general idea behind capitalism is that people with excess capital can make it available to those with less capital to help them bring good ideas and productivity to fruition, with both parties enjoying the benefits. While not all aspects of capitalism are good, this core underpinning of capitalism is why I roll my eyes a little bit when people suggest that capitalism is a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, capitalism only works if the resources are going towards productive projects. If the money gets invested in projects that don&amp;#8217;t create more value and jobs, it has caused more harm than good. Bear markets are the filter by which we cut out bad projects. It&amp;#8217;s a blunt tool, to be sure, but we&amp;#8217;d rather eliminate cancer with the relatively barbaric practice of chemotherapy than to let it spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bear markets are good for the world in the long run, even if they&amp;#8217;re bad for us in the short run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know how I always talk about building out a long financial runway and living below one&amp;#8217;s means? The current situation is exactly the reason why, even though it&amp;#8217;s hard to imagine such a situation during boom times. Use this as motivation to get to that place, and maybe more importantly, to stay there even when things go back up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves the old &amp;#8220;buy low sell high&amp;#8221; saying, but then when things are actually low they get scared and forget to buy. Most of the times someone tells me they&amp;#8217;re buying an asset it&amp;#8217;s when it&amp;#8217;s at an all time high and they think it&amp;#8217;s going even higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s no telling what will happen in the future, but if you actually did enough research on an asset to believe in it for the long term, you should be thrilled that it&amp;#8217;s cheaper now. If you didn&amp;#8217;t do enough research… you may not be thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also important to understand why we&amp;#8217;re in a bear market right now. The primary reason is that there is a liquidity crisis. As interest rates go up, people need more cash to service loans. Where do they get that cash? They sell assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When they sell assets the prices of those assets go down. People often borrow against assets (both equities and crypto), so when those prices go down they have less collateral. If they get close to a threshold where they will be liquidated, they must sell as well. This causes a spiral downwards until asset prices become so attractive that those with cash on the side can&amp;#8217;t help but buy them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, an oversimplification of what&amp;#8217;s going on, but it is the major driver. It&amp;#8217;s also done by design. The fed is raising rates to cause exactly this to happen, because with too much easy money in the system people were too eager to buy and caused inflation. Consider it a controlled forest fire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m invested in Ethereum because I am totally convinced that it is going to be a major part of the future. I have no idea if it was overvalued at $5k earlier this year or even today at closer to $1k, but I believe that it will be far higher in the future (to throw a random guess out, I&amp;#8217;d guess $15-20k within 2 years). If Ethereum had dropped because it was hacked or a competitor came and absolutely destroyed it, I would sell it at a loss. But since nothing has changed in terms of my core conviction of it being part of the future (and further conviction that the market doesn&amp;#8217;t even understand what it can do today), I&amp;#8217;m happy to keep buying now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An analogy might be that if I&amp;#8217;m wet because my boat is sinking, I&amp;#8217;ll get off the boat. If I&amp;#8217;m wet because it&amp;#8217;s raining, I&amp;#8217;ll stay on the boat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Ethereum hit its low point in the last cycle I funded a crypto 401k and bought Ethereum at $80. Even though I already had Ethereum, it didn&amp;#8217;t bother me that it was that low because nothing had changed in my conviction of its future importance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This principle also applies to investing in the stock market. I believe that the world economy will continue to grow in the long term, so I&amp;#8217;m happy to add more cash to my all weather portfolio, even though parts of it are down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A bear market is also a good time to realize that most of your happiness and satisfaction in life will not come from earning money or spending money, but from how you spend your time and the relationships you build. While it&amp;#8217;s a little bit less fun for me to daydream about things I might buy in the near future, it&amp;#8217;s just as satisfying to sit down and have tea with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use the bear market as an opportunity to test your convictions and to learn more about what you&amp;#8217;ve invested in. Make structural changes to your life and finances so that if this bear market put you in a tough position, the next one won&amp;#8217;t. If you&amp;#8217;re still happy about the investments you have and your lifestyle hasn&amp;#8217;t had to change much or at all even with asset prices down across the board, congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that I consider to be the most important things to think about and focus on, primarily because they have enormous downstream effects that impact almost everything else in your life. Ironically, they also tend to be things that no one else prioritizes. A few are good sleep, social skills, and decision making. Most people try to make good decisions, but never actually think about their decision making processes, never work on social skills at all, and fit sleep in around everything else they do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There others, too, like health, positivity, frugality, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Decision making might be the most important one, because it&amp;#8217;s the operating system under which you live your life. Will you prioritize sleep? That depends on how you make your decisions, and that&amp;#8217;s why I always write about decision making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was thinking the other day about making quick decisions vs slow decisions. I think that I make great decisions most of the time, but as I thought about it I couldn&amp;#8217;t decide whether I make quick decisions or slow decisions. I could think of examples of times that I&amp;#8217;ve done both. As I thought about it more, I realized that I was patient but decisive. I probably learned this from poker, where the optimal strategy is to play tight (choose only good cards) but aggressively once you&amp;#8217;re playing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few examples from my own life:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I got married when I was in my late thirties. Up until I met my wife I think most people observing me would have thought that I was making very little progress towards getting married. But we got married on our one year anniversary. I knew what I was looking for and was content to be patient in finding it, but then once I did I made a very quick decisive decision to get married (as you&amp;#8217;d expect, the same was true of my wife).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was a particular neighborhood in Vegas that I really wanted to move into since coming to Vegas. I liked my old neighborhood as well, but it was literally one of the least expensive neighborhoods in all of Vegas and was generally considered to be a bit of a ghetto. Rather than get in over my head and buy a house in the new neighborhood before I could afford it, buy a bad house in the good neighborhood, or move to a neighborhood that was almost as good, I just waited patiently. And then when we could afford it comfortably and a good house became available, we bought it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth mentioning that we bought right as covid was heating up the market, and had we waited for a house that was 100% perfect (vs. one that had everything we needed to eventually make it perfect), we may have ended up becoming priced out. Our house would cost about 60% more now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patient but decisive sounds simple, but there&amp;#8217;s some nuance to it. Both patience and decisiveness should be sourced from the same place: standards. The two most common mistakes I see people make are that they have no standards and just evaluate things arbitrarily, or that their standards could never be met in reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take home buying for example. We wanted big windows, a pool, a good sized backyard, enough rooms for both of us to have an office, and a good area for a tea room (ok, maybe my wife didn&amp;#8217;t care about that one), and a gym. The house we ended up buying isn&amp;#8217;t perfect. It had really bad landscaping, tiny bathrooms, a loud air conditioner, and some pretty ugly interior features. But because we knew that it met the important standards, we looked past the downsides. Now the interior and landscaping are beautiful, we&amp;#8217;ve adapted to smaller bathrooms, and we&amp;#8217;ve gotten used to the air conditioner and will replace it with a quieter one when it breaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Same with dating. I&amp;#8217;m sure neither my wife nor I are perfect for the other, but we checked all the most important boxes and we&amp;#8217;ve figured out the rest as we&amp;#8217;ve gone on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of patience is taking the time to evaluate what your standards actually are. What do you need? What do you want? What will move something from the category of &amp;#8220;bad decision&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;good decision&amp;#8221;? Really thinking these things through up front makes it easier to say no to things while you wait for the right one, and also makes it easier to say yes quickly once something fits those criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also easy to set standards that are too high. If you&amp;#8217;re single now and are waiting to find someone who is perfect in every way, you will probably fail. And in the meantime you&amp;#8217;re living many years without the benefit of a partner. There&amp;#8217;s some middle ground where having a partner is much better than being single, even if that person isn&amp;#8217;t totally perfect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we were buying a house it was even more straightforward. We knew which factors mattered to us, but it was easy to not get carried away because we couldn&amp;#8217;t find any houses that were roughly 2-3x the price of ours that we would rather move into.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who are patient are often patient for the wrong reason, though, and that comes out when it&amp;#8217;s time to act. Indecisiveness can be masked under the guise of patience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patience is an investment that only pays off if a good decision is actually made in the end. Usually what prevents people from making good decisions is fear of missing a perfect decision. What if you there was a better option right around the corner? If you think about people who operate with that sort of mindset, you&amp;#8217;ll probably notice that their lives seem to move very slowly. That&amp;#8217;s because they miss 20 opportunities to make 10-50% improvements while they wait for a magical 100% improvement. Even if they find that big perfect opportunity down the road, they&amp;#8217;re still further behind than they would have been if they had just been making great-but-not-perfect decisions the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our neighborhood is mostly very beautiful houses that would be great to live in. But if you were to search for it on a real estate site, you&amp;#8217;d see that most of the houses look terrible. Why is that? It&amp;#8217;s because the good ones go fast, usually under a week, leaving only the bad ones on the market. If you can make a quick decision once your criteria are met, you will end up with a good house. If you always take a week to make a decision, you would never get a good house.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My life would be radically different (and, I assume, worse) if I added just 24 hours to each decision I made. Many of the defining opportunities in my life are a result of quick decisions. Decisiveness often looks like luck from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Know what matters to you in a decision, whether it&amp;#8217;s where you&amp;#8217;re going to live, what career or job you will take, or who will be in your life. Be patient enough to wait for the right opportunity, and then jump on it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photo is the dome at the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. I went to Istanbul for the first time earlier this month, and I think it may have been the first new country I&amp;#8217;ve been to this year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I put in a lot of work to redo my mail server and I&amp;#8217;ll be using this as a test email. I know that many people haven&amp;#8217;t gotten emails from the last few posts, but I now have more info being logged so I&amp;#8217;m hoping to figure it out on this one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/patient/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/patient/#comments</comments><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2022 20:26:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What I’ve Been Thinking and Doing</title><link>https://tynan.com/august2022/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="563" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/20220819_111048-1024x768.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 75%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="750" /&gt;One of the downsides of writing less frequently is that I feel more pressure for each post to be impactful (even though readers have pretty consistently told me that they just want me to write anything).

&lt;p&gt;One of the downsides of writing less frequently is that I feel more pressure for each post to be impactful (even though readers have pretty consistently told me that they just want me to write anything). This post will be a meandering one without much of a point other than to let you know what I&amp;#8217;m thinking about and working on these days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve found myself more frequently thinking about time I spend in front of screens and connected to notifications. I&amp;#8217;ve also found myself becoming more and more nostalgic, even for times in which I wasn&amp;#8217;t alive! I saw a 70s commercial (I was born in the 80s) for a toy and it evoked some sort of warm memory of a simpler time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I was young my whole family, including family members who I was barely related to, would go to my Aunt Nina&amp;#8217;s house every Christmas eve. It was a tiny house in a non-affluent area. The floors were linoleum and shag carpeting, neither of which were really &amp;#8220;in&amp;#8221; at the time. There was one small picture of Jesus on the wall that I remember. Fifty or more people would cram into this apartment and we&amp;#8217;d eat simple home-cooked Italian food off of disposable plates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then us kids would lie on the shag carpeting, because there was only one small couch that was used by adults, and we&amp;#8217;d sneak a bunch of candies from the candy tray while we watched some Christmas rerun on her tiny console TV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m extremely happy now, but I can&amp;#8217;t remember a time that was happier than those Christmas Eves. It was just nice to be totally surrounded by my family. I even found myself nostalgic for how freezing I&amp;#8217;d be outside as I shuffled across the ice afterwards to get in the warm car.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Am I nostalgic for all of this because it&amp;#8217;s so long ago that I can only remember the good parts? Is it because I miss family members who have died since then? Is it because I don&amp;#8217;t get to see my family that often, and because covid has messed up our plans for a few years? Or is there a level of connection and presence that is more elusive these days with all of our devices?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was just on a cruise and my friend &lt;a href="http://party.pro"&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; and I decided to not use the internet for the first 60 hours. I expected it to be difficult and profound, but it really wasn&amp;#8217;t either. I read a few books, we played shuffleboard, we had tea and chatted, and then we got into port and turned our phones back on. I thought I&amp;#8217;d have a big blog post to write about what I learned, but I really didn&amp;#8217;t learn anything. I was fine without internet and devices and it was fine to go back to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If some of the happiest moments I can think of are being stuffed in a tiny apartment with my family eating (admittedly excellent) Italian food, then why am I doing any of the things I&amp;#8217;m doing? Why do I work? Why do I try to make our house so nice?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At some point computer work seemed to be my best avenue for reaching my goals, so I was on it all day and it was easy to justify. Why am I still doing it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;m thinking about and &amp;#8220;working on&amp;#8221;. I read a book called &amp;#8220;Lost Focus&amp;#8221; that I really liked. I&amp;#8217;m trying some experiments with structuring my day and turning things off. I think what I&amp;#8217;m really trying to figure out is how to prioritize connection and presence in a world that doesn&amp;#8217;t prioritize those things, and even around people who (maybe even correctly!) don&amp;#8217;t prioritize them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been weird not writing every week. I don&amp;#8217;t love it, but I also didn&amp;#8217;t love the pressure of writing every week. It feels like I don&amp;#8217;t have as many interesting things to say these days, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because I&amp;#8217;m not very interesting now! I think there&amp;#8217;s some element of truth to that, as 5-10 years ago I was definitely more in a phase of actively trying to figure things out and explore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also feel like I&amp;#8217;ve said most of what I have to say, at least at this point. The principles that I&amp;#8217;ve settled upon over the last decade have served me well and continue to do so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past I really wanted to be famous, partially because I was naïve enough to think it was a good thing on its own, but also because I saw it as an accelerant towards meeting my goals. Now in the era of wokeness and cancel culture, it feels like a liability (especially when you were once a pickup artist). On the other hand, my small amount of fame opened some interesting doors for me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So once in a while I think: &amp;#8220;I will make a YouTube Show!&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I will make a Podcast&amp;#8221;! And then I think about what I&amp;#8217;d get out of it if it went extremely well, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure I even want that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden last month I got motivated to work on CruiseSheet again (even before the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEtiMOiEUec&amp;amp;lc=Ugycn4ZjdyeL5jr2vqB4AaABAg"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2022/07/13/cruises-cheaper-booking-summer/10048495002/"&gt;press&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cheap-travel-cruises-sales-bargains-11657485614"&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt;). I&amp;#8217;m not sure why, but I was back in that mode of waking up thinking about reorganizing the database, and then ending the day thinking &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s 3am… I guess I should stop working&amp;#8221;. It felt great! I&amp;#8217;m still riding that wave a month later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I&amp;#8217;ve been working a lot on my email server / software. Hopefully you got this post by email if you&amp;#8217;ve subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about CruiseSheet is that it&amp;#8217;s an endless source of interesting problems for me to tackle. Sometimes I wonder if I should be more motivated to turn it into something bigger, or if I should just be happy that it fits into my life so well as it is. Recently it&amp;#8217;s been growing to the point where I may not have much of a choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OkDork"&gt;Noah&lt;/a&gt; has two (TWO!) pinball machines in his house. My wife and I stayed there last week and got obsessed with Godzilla pinball, so naturally as soon as I got home I started building my own virtual pinball machine. I don&amp;#8217;t have a good space for a full cabinet, so I&amp;#8217;m designing a folding one that will hide in the closet and then fold out into the guest room when we want to play. I love projects like this. I get to research all sorts of stuff, stubbornly make my own thing because none of the existing ones are quite right, and learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we first moved in, I built a fake beam in our living room to hide a drop-down projector screen. It was affixed to the wall on one side but hung from a metal cable on the other. I did that because the cable-side is a stone fireplace and I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how to best attach it. Well, one day while I was gone the whole thing came crashing down. I guess I didn&amp;#8217;t get enough of a bite on the wood where I hung the hook for it. The screen still works and only needed a few minor cosmetic repairs, so now I&amp;#8217;m designing a better beam that will go from edge to edge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oh, speaking of projects, I&amp;#8217;m also trying to build a spa in my backyard. My dad and I built the exterior structure (glorified shed with huge windows) and I&amp;#8217;ve bought all of the equipment for the inside. I started running the electrical in the early summer, but eventually it was too hot. It will be cool soon, so I want to get it done soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m taking September off from traveling. Maybe not completely, but I realized recently that every time I get back to Vegas I feel so happy and excited to be here, and that I keep wishing I had more days before my next trip. So unless I can figure out how to go to Japan, I&amp;#8217;ll probably spend most of the time here. I&amp;#8217;ve been here a few days already and it feels great to have a normal routine, to be able to work on my projects, and to only eat Chipotle. As you can tell, I have a LOT of projects I need to finish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photo is of my tea set on the Danube river! I did my first river cruise and really liked it, though maybe not as much as ocean cruises. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last trip I did in August was a trip to Austin, Texas. I stayed with my good friend &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/OkDork"&gt;Noah Kagan&lt;/a&gt;, who happens to have two pinball machines in his house. I&amp;#8217;ve never really understood pinball, having only played it a handful of times in my life. But my wife and I ended up playing Godzilla pinball twice a day, competing but also encouraging each other and trying to figure out the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At some point, for some reason, I had researched virtual pinball tables. Companies make these tables that are the same size as a real pinball table and have the same controls, but instead of a mechanical playfield, they have a monitor. The problem is that the tables cost at least $5000 and tend not to use the quality of hardware that I thought would make for a good experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should make a pinball table, I thought. I have a couple extra monitors of an appropriate size, an extra gaming PC, and some plywood. I could probably whip something up for next to nothing in a few days…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had some other projects I wanted to do and a couple others to complete, so I decided that I would stay in Vegas for about a month and get stuff done. This also coincided with some friends being in Vegas, and the beginning of the NHL preseason. I also found that rather than constantly looking forward to the next trip, as I usually do, I found myself looking forward to the next time I&amp;#8217;d get to be in Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the projects I did in September, along with some thoughts on them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projector Screen Beam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-3693" height="768" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220925_174054-1-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In case it&amp;#8217;s not obvious, the projector screen drops down from the illuminated white thing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I lived in my old condo, I found someone on Craigslist selling a $1700 in-ceiling projector screen for $300 or so. I went and bought it, only to discover that my rafters went the wrong way for actually installed it in the ceiling. And, sure enough, when we moved it still had to be oriented perpendicular to the rafters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I bought some 1&amp;#215;6 pieces of wood, and built a box for it. One side was attached directly to the wall, but the other side would have been up against an irregular stone surface. Eager to avoid the challenge of mating the wood with the stone, and also happy to buy 12 foot boards rather than 16 footers, I hung the box from the ceiling with a metal cable and just had a 3-4&amp;#8243; gap between it and the stone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most guests either didn&amp;#8217;t notice or were polite enough not to say anything about the gap, but my siblings constantly harassed me about it and wanted me to take it down and rebuild it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I came home from a trip, walked into the living room and thought, &amp;#8220;Hmm… something looks different here&amp;#8221;. A few seconds later I realized that the projector screen and beam had fallen down. Luckily the things that got smashed on the way down were either replaceable or fixable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If I was going to have to fix the beam, I thought, I may as well go wall to wall. So I designed a new system, 3D printed some custom french cleats for each side, got a contour gauge and a fancy 4-beam laser level, and built the beam the way it probably should have been built from the beginning. By absolute random chance the face of the rock to which I had to adhere it was almost flat, so it was easy to build it without a gap. My siblings are happy now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot Tub Controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Months ago, back when it was actually cold enough to use a hot tub regularly, the &amp;#8220;temperature up&amp;#8221; button on our hot tub broke. This wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been much of a problem, since we generally keep it at the same temperature and I was already controlling the temperature using a smart plug since the thermometer had also broken, but while diagnosing the issue I hit the down button too many times, meaning that the hot tub could never get above a tepid 96 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Replacement controllers were about $100, which felt like a rip off to me. I finally ordered one, but when it arrived I realized it was for a similar but not quite the same hot tub. Annoyed with both the hot tub and myself for not researching enough, I decided I was going to take things into my own hands and design my own hot tub controller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I bought an ESP32 board, and learned how to use it. These things are absolutely incredible. For $10 a pop they have built in bluetooth, wifi, storage, tons of header pins, and are easy enough to program in C++. There are many great libraries for them, so you don&amp;#8217;t have to figure out how to make it connect to wifi yourself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Components for them are just generic components like LCDs, 8 segment displays, standard thermometers, etc., so most things you&amp;#8217;d want to add to them just cost a few dollars. Within a week my desk was messier than it had ever been, littered with different buttons, displays, thermometers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had a fully functioning interface with button and a two line screen, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t come up with an acceptable way to package it on the surface of the hot tub and make sure it was waterproof. Eventually I had a trip coming up and I didn&amp;#8217;t want the hot tub water to go stagnant, so I got rid of the display and just controlled it with wifi. Without time to properly integrate the circuitry into the old case, I left the guts of the controller on a piece of wood next to the hot tub and put a bucket over it to keep it dry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then we had the craziest storms I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen in Vegas, and the thing got destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ok, fine, I thought. Time to finish it. I settled on a design I had been toying with before. The visible portion of the controller appeared to be a solid black piece of plastic (printed in 3D), but behind less than a millimeter of the plastic was a matrix of red LEDs to provide a simple screen. Rather than add buttons, I used an accelerometer to do tap detection. One tap turns the light on and off, two taps turns the pump/heater on and off. I never change the temperature when I&amp;#8217;m in the tub, so I left that as a wifi-only feature. I managed to fit all of the circuitry, relays, and wires into the old case and make it so that I can update the software over wifi.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I build a bunch of cool features like automatically running a cleaning cycle after 6 hours of inactivity, turning the light off after an hour of inactivity, and freeze protection. I installed a new light into the lighting recess and put an RGB bulb in it that can be controlled over infrared. In the next iteration I will probably hide an infrared emitter in the controller and use it to slowly fade colors like a James Turrell experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinball&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Batman &amp;#8217;66 playing on the pinball machine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I propped up my previous two computer monitors, which I can&amp;#8217;t trouble myself to sell, but are useful and valuable enough that I keep them around. One is 39&amp;#8243; and one is 43&amp;#8243;. I leaned one up against my wall and propped the other one up on a couple 2x4s to raise it a few inches above the ground. I installed the pinball software on a computer I had previously used to mine ethereum (and thus it had a good graphics card). The experience was exactly on the line of being enjoyable enough that I thought it was worth building a full cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The playfield monitor is at a fairly extreme angle, since you are looking at it from the side, so the colors were washed out. And, at 60Hz (frames per second), the ball didn&amp;#8217;t move fluidly enough to convince me it was real. On the other hand, I found myself sitting on the floor several times a day to try to get further in Attack From Mars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I did more research. The ideal monitor is the LG 43&amp;#8243; C2 OLED. It runs at 120Hz, has HDR, is 4k, and is pretty much the exact correct size for a pinball playfield. The problem is that it&amp;#8217;s $1200. I couldn&amp;#8217;t get myself to plunk down that much cash for a pinball machine that I wasn&amp;#8217;t even fully committed to building yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I searched around Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist, though, and found its predecessor, the C1 for $400. In all important ways the specs were the same, but the smallest one was a 48&amp;#8243;. There were a couple mentions of people using monitors this big for pinball online, so I decided to go for it. I drove across Vegas and bought the TV from a guy&amp;#8217;s living room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As soon as I hooked it up, I knew that I was going to build the pinball cabinet. The 120 frames per second made a day and night difference, the colors were rich ever from the playing angle, and the tables just looked great.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem remaining was that I had nowhere to put the table. My tea room is large and has plenty of space, but if there&amp;#8217;s anything that&amp;#8217;s the opposite of a tea room vibe, it&amp;#8217;s pinball. I could put it in my wife&amp;#8217;s office, but it&amp;#8217;s already become a graveyard for purchases that I make that she won&amp;#8217;t let me get rid of (like a full electric piano), so I decided to only put it there as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, I thought, what if I designed a table that was much shallower and could be affixed to the wall in the closet of the guest room? We don&amp;#8217;t use the guest room most of the time, so it could be folded out normally, but then it would hinge upwards when we had guests. I got to work on Sketchup and confirmed that it would work. Rather than 15.5 inches in front, mine would be only 4. It would have the same slope as a normal sized cabinet, as if the bottom 8 inches were cut off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I got the plywood and built it in the living room, since it was too hot and sunny to do it outside. Building the actual cabinet went really well, with relatively few hiccups. Getting the paper thing but very heavy monitor centered was the biggest challenge. On a lark I put in a gas spring so that it could pop up and open like a car hood, thinking &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m pretty much done, but maybe I&amp;#8217;ll need to get in here in the future&amp;#8221;. Little did I know just how many times I would open it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people put 8-10 solenoids in their cabinets. A solenoid is a mechanical device that uses a magnet to move a rod. They make the characteristic loud thunk noises you hear in real pinball machines, as they move flippers, bumpers, and singshots. I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how deep down the rabbit hole I wanted to go, so I decided not to use solenoids. Instead I did something called SSF, which is essentially four &amp;#8220;actuators&amp;#8221;, which are speakers that screw into and shake physical materials. They are arranged in the corners of the cabinet and the table uses them as an internal surround sound matrix to mimic the internal noises of the pinball machine. It is uncanny how well it works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not fully understanding what every part was, I ended up accidentally ordering a device that acts a bridge between the computer and any lights you may not have on the cabinet. It has 32 slots. A regular light uses one, a light that can change to any color (RGB) uses three. I had zero used, but I had an extra leftover piece of LED strip lighting, so I hooked it up as an experiment. People have literally programmed color changes for every major action in every game, so it immediately made the room flash in tune with every game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-3694" height="768" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220925_152046-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Resistor board for 5 RGB lights&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fast forward, and now I use all 32 slots. The flipper buttons light up to the correct color for each game, I have two bright white strobe lights aimed at the player&amp;#8217;s face, and I even spent 10 hours hooking up 5 physical flashers at the back of the cabinet (and designed and 3D printed mounts and lenses for them in the process). The result is almost an overwhelming amount of stimulation that really brings you into the game and bridges the gap between a virtual pinball machine and a real one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Things were going well and I was heading towards the finish line. The time had come to move the pinball machine off the floor and mount it onto the wall. I built a small box to screw into the studs of the wall and attached a piano hinge. The box was just deep enough to hold the other monitor, which shows the game art and scoreboard, behind the playfield.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I screwed the box to the wall and just as I was about to go get the cabinet I had a shocking realization&amp;#8211; I had never actually measured the vertical clearance. It looked like the cabinet would fold up on the hinge but wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to clear the top of the closet&amp;#8217;s sliding door frame. I grabbed a tape measure and confirmed… there was no way it would fit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I considered lowering the machine, but then it wouldn&amp;#8217;t feel like a real pinball machine. I thought about cutting through the door frame. I thought about moving it to a different room. I very nearly cut a massive chunk out of the wall to embed the entire back part of the machine in the wall, but I still would have had to lower it by a few inches. I asked twitter to see if anyone could design some sort of double-pivot hinge that would lower the machine as it folded towards the wall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then I finally had an idea that seemed like it had promise. What if I could find some sort of motor to lower it temporarily, fold it up, and then raise it? At this point the project had been all consuming for a week or two and I knew that I was well beyond the realm of reason and so far from the original vision of slapping something together with spare parts I had lying around. After a bunch of searching, I ordered a TV lift and figured I could repurpose it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shockingly, it worked almost perfectly. It&amp;#8217;s strong enough to raise and lower the TV. It&amp;#8217;s only weakness is that it allows the table to sway too much left and right. To solve that I bought leveling feet, attached them to the back box, and aimed them towards the wall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still waiting for some custom metal stuff for the top trim, and after that I&amp;#8217;ll have to custom order a piece of glass, but besides that the table is pretty much done. What kept me going through all of it is that every time I was frustrated I would play a few games of pinball and it just kept getting more and more fun. The best part was being able to play with friends. Every friend that came over immediately got into pinball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I love doing projects. Even though I took no flights for a month, September was one of the most enjoyable months of my year. It&amp;#8217;s just so satisfying building something with your hands, and trying to solve the inevitable problems that come up is like navigating an escape game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two things really stood out to me during the month. The first is that it&amp;#8217;s incredible what you can manufacture at home these days. In particular, the hot tub controller feels very close to a commercial product, but was really easy to make. 3D printers plus cheap general purpose electronics like arduinos, ESP32s, and even raspberry pis open up nearly infinite possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second thing that stood out was how if you&amp;#8217;re stubborn enough, you can generally figure out how to do something. I was pretty set on having a really shallow pinball table that would fit inside that closet, and even though there were some frustrating roadblocks along the way, I figured it out eventually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finally in Tokyo again after 2.5 years! What an amazing and bizarre feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://tynan.com/projects/</guid><comments>https://tynan.com/projects/#comments</comments><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 22:40:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Believing Anything is Possible</title><link>https://tynan.com/anything/</link><description>&lt;img alt="" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" height="563" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/signal-2022-10-12-145516_004-1024x768.jpeg" style="width: 100%; height: 75%; float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;" width="750" /&gt;My friend Brian and I got back to the island for the first time in a year.

&lt;p&gt;My friend Brian and I got back to the island for the first time in a year. The owners have various levels of interest and ability in getting to the island and working on it, but Brian and I are generally the two who do the big projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s interesting working with Brian, because in some ways our approach is very different. He tends to plan ahead and prepare for every contingency. I tend to figure out the first couple steps, get working on them, and adjust as I go. This sometimes causes us to butt heads, though I think we also influence each other a bit. When I built my pinball cabinet, I actually drew the key parts out in Sketchup first, as he would.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian also loves tea, so most mornings on the island are a couple hours of us sitting around the fire, drinking good tea, having conversations. One conversation we had was about how we both believe anything is possible, and how useful that belief is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On this particular trip, it was particularly useful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Fiona had come through and caused more damage than any hurricane since we got the island. I knew we were going to be in trouble when our mainland neighbor texted me the night before saying, &amp;#8220;Hey, this hurricane is going to be huge. We&amp;#8217;ll hope for the best and I&amp;#8217;ll let you know how bad the damage is tomorrow.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the nine years we&amp;#8217;ve had the island there have been plenty of hurricanes, but he never warned us before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His damage report was both reassuring and perplexing. The damage wasn&amp;#8217;t bad, he said. My cabin seemed safe and the only notable damage on the yurt was that the clear plastic dome cap was somehow missing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Immediately, the dome cap made me wonder what was going on. The roof is a cone shape, with rafters attaching to a heavy-duty dome ring. The ring is two layers of 2x6s screwed together and with the outside cut into a circle. On top of the dome ring was a heavy-duty hard plastic dome cap that would let sunlight in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been on the roof many times in failed efforts to make the seal between the dome cap and the dome ring actually be waterproof, so I&amp;#8217;m very familiar with it. It was attached with 18-24 big screws, so I couldn&amp;#8217;t imagine a situation that would cause the dome cap to be ripped off, but otherwise leave the yurt ok. I was nervous to inspect the damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first everything seemed ok. We had water damage, but had the foresight to buy mostly waterproof furniture, and the neighbors had come in and set stuff up to dry out. But when we looked closer at the dome ring, we realized something really terrible had happened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the boards that composed the dome ring had rotted and cracked under pressure, causing the ring to cave in on itself. The two ends that should have been butting up against each other were instead on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would be really easy to throw up our hands at this point. A storm wrecked our yurt, and we don&amp;#8217;t have any experience with repairing roofs, let alone yurt roofs. The force of the rafters collapsing the circle was great, and it was obvious that any solution that would be successful would require something neither of us had done before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you believe anything is possible, though, you just get to work. I think we both knew that we would leave the island with the problem solved, so figuring out how we were going to get it done was really just like solving a puzzle. Without the &amp;#8220;can we or can&amp;#8217;t we&amp;#8221; question looming, you just start figuring out solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We brainstormed a bit and came up with a general plan involving some clamps and temporary blocking to help us get a grip on the ring. We decided that we&amp;#8217;d use two clamps to open the ring back up, another to push it back to being flush, and once in place we&amp;#8217;d replace the rotted wood and add a new reinforcing ring along the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After replacing one clamp that didn&amp;#8217;t have enough leverage and a couple small setbacks, we got it done. Once we had everything in place, it took two hours of constant minor adjustments to move the edges of the ring about six inches. Making the supporting ring was easy, as was building a waterproof cap to replace the plastic dome until we can come up with something better next year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-3701" height="768" src="https://tynan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/signal-2022-10-12-145516_003-1024x768.jpeg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brian putting the finishing touches on the reinforcement ring&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of us really know what is or isn&amp;#8217;t possible, but I&amp;#8217;d say that most people way underestimate what is possible. I&amp;#8217;m always surprised at how early people give up on things or how little confidence they have that they can figure out how to make something work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not just like you can just substitute things that you know are possible for those that you aren&amp;#8217;t sure of. The best things tend to be the things that people doubt, but that you pursue with the belief that anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I saw weaknesses in online casinos, I believed that there was some way I could make a living from them. My first attempt was a total failure and I had bumps along the way, but in the end it supported me for nine years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I admit that at first I did not believe it was possible for me to date the kind of girls I wanted to date, but as soon as I caught a glimpse of what was possible, I believed that I could do it and I rose through the pickup world and eventually married an amazing woman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the first moment I saw an advertisement for an island in a magazine, I believed that I could own and island. And now I get to do luxurious things like repair rotten roofs cracked apart by hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When my college friends and I had the idea of buying a school bus, we believed that it was possible and called around until we found one we could afford, and drove it home the next day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before digital nomads were a thing, my friend Todd and I believed that it was possible to live inexpensively around the world as nomads. We sold all of our things and figured it out as we went.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before anyone had ever heard of #vanlife, I thought that it would be possible to have a great life living in an RV, so I bought one and moved into it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A friend suggested that I write a book, and because I believed that it was possible to write one quickly, I stayed up for two days straight and wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believed that it was possible to organize my friends to find inexpensive but great apartments to share in our favorite cities, and now we&amp;#8217;re in Tokyo, Hawaii, and Budapest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve been reading my blog for a while, all of these things are familiar to you and are many of the bulletpoints of &amp;#8220;who Tynan is&amp;#8221;. You might notice, though, that none of them were things that I had any advantage or ability with. In fact, many of them were the opposite. The primary reason I achieved most of the things I achieved was that I believed they were possible and was content to keep walking on the path towards them and deal with whatever came my way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you believe that anything is possible, you will sometimes be wrong. I believed that Todd and I could build a better blogging platform and create a successful business around it. I actually still do believe that it was possible, but that we failed at it. There&amp;#8217;s no way to know for sure, of course.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, it&amp;#8217;s better to believe anything is possible and be proven wrong occasionally than to believe many things are impossible and to prove yourself right all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;#8217;s gratitude post was written largely about my father coming to Vegas to help me with some home improvement projects, so it feels fitting that I&amp;#8217;m writing this as I fly across the country to help him with some projects of his own. And, as always, family looms large at the top of my list of things I am grateful for, especially as I&amp;#8217;ve gotten to spend more time with so many family members than in the past couple years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But first, this year, I&amp;#8217;m grateful for my wife. In the same way that I didn&amp;#8217;t really understand just how great my parents were until I got older and heard stories from other friends about their relationships with their parents, as time has gone on and I&amp;#8217;ve heard more about situations that friends find themselves in with their marriages and dating lives, I appreciate just how lucky I am.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t write much about my wife in the interest of privacy, but I wanted to mention her first, even if not in much detail. I appreciate her mindset, her openness and enthusiasm for random new activities like hockey and pinball, and how she has embraced my friends and family. We have an amazing life together and I&amp;#8217;m grateful for all that she has contributed to create it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m also grateful that travel has opened up again. Not being able to go to some of my favorite places for so long renewed my gratitude for them and helped reinforce just how lucky I am to be able to call so many places sort-of-home. I almost cried the first time I went to Budapest after covid and again almost cried when I stepped foot in Tokyo after 2.5 years of not visiting. The miracle of flight, the people I&amp;#8217;m close to in all of these cities, and the places they&amp;#8217;ve become through their histories are all incredible to me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few days ago one of my friends had a big friendsgiving celebration. He and his wife put together a full gauntlet of games to play like real-life hungry hungry hippos, balloon volleyball, multi-stage trivia, and a weird simulated snowball fight game. As my wife, my friends and I smashed balloons at each other I thought about how lucky I was to have such kind and creative friends who can have this much fun, especially without alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cruise industry rebounded this year, and CruiseSheet is doing better than ever. I&amp;#8217;m grateful for the success, but even more grateful for the unlimited number of interesting challenges and projects it presents. Ironically I found myself on a cruise (one of my favorite activities), looking forward to being back on shore so that I could have faster internet so that I could work more on CruiseSheet. I&amp;#8217;m also grateful that CruiseSheet is automated enough that if I don&amp;#8217;t want to work for a while, like the entire pandemic, it will just keep on ticking by itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I turned 40 recently, which gives me free license to talk like an old man, so I&amp;#8217;ll take the opportunity and say that I&amp;#8217;m grateful for my health. I&amp;#8217;ve never really had to go to the doctor or take medicine, and I feel great every day. I do a decent job of keeping a healthy, but I know that I&amp;#8217;ve also been lucky to have good genes and to avoid the sorts of accidents that could happen to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never done a gratitude journal, but I have an internal one that I crack open many times a day. I guess it&amp;#8217;s easy when you have a good life, but as I look at the people in my life, the places I get to experience, and even mundane things like how the delivery people show up with Chipotle every day, I can&amp;#8217;t help but feel nearly overwhelmed with gratitude every day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Years ago I had the revelation that if you aren&amp;#8217;t grateful for the things in your life you shouldn&amp;#8217;t bother getting more things in your life, because you also won&amp;#8217;t be grateful for them. That caused me to focus more on appreciating the things I have, and it&amp;#8217;s been a valuable practice. It causes me to get 100% of the joy out of everything in my life. When I see people who complain about everything I feel bad for them because I know they have a lot to be grateful for that they just aren&amp;#8217;t able to appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last, thanks to you for reading. I know it&amp;#8217;s a little bit annoying that I only write once per month now, but I appreciate your support and that you take time out of your life to read what I have to write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Photo is a sunset at the island. Hard to not be grateful when I&amp;#8217;m standing there looking at that.
