Could one party take both houses of Congress? How is the Presidential race shaping up? And will American voters have to jack up their pandemic risk just to plunk down a ballot?

They’re exploring huge, meaningful, world-altering ways the 1990s never stopped happening to us. They’ll also reveal which element of the ‘90s stuffs the nation’s landfills to this day, which ‘90s band happily played a show in a living room, and which ‘90s after-effects are most worth looking out for in 2020, 2024, and beyond.

              <itunes:summary>Alex Schmidt is joined by Jody Avirgan (FiveThirtyEight, 30 For 30) and Nicole Hemmer (historian, author 'Messengers Of The Right'). Jody &amp; Nicole host a fantastic new podcast called 'This Day In Esoteric Political History'. On this show, the three of them share amazing stories from T.D.I.E.P.H., and from elsewhere, about America facing shutdown-level crises. It turns out the United States often faces pandemics, crashes, and weather cataclysms that disrupt national life for months or even years. Those events don't loom large in our collective historical memories, despite being important reminders of our country's resilience in the face of bizarre national danger...and reminders that thoughtful collective action is as American as apple pie, baseball, and revolting against the British.

              <itunes:summary>Alex Schmidt is joined by the incredible Andy Daly, star of ’Review’ and all of the rest of TV. This podcast is inspired by Dalton Wilcox’s long-simmering project ‘Bonanas For Bonanza’, a rewatch podcast (theoretically) tackling all 431 episodes of the 1959-1973 Western adventure TV show ‘Bonanza’. It turns out even the earliest 'Bonanza' episodes are quite odd -- which begs the question, how weird can a long-running show get? Alex and Andy answer that with examples (and audio!) from ‘Gunsmoke’, ‘One Tree Hill’, ‘Lassie’, and more surprising pillars of American television history.

Why does your culture, no matter who you are, spend time and resources and energy on a set of traditions? What are we missing if we become Too Modern to value a break from everyday life? And how can anyone generate a holiday feeling in their own heart, any time of the year?

              <itunes:summary>Anything can happen in a fictional world. Stories take us to the farthest reaches of the galaxy, or the fantasy-est realms ever conceived, or the grittiest most realistic representations of everyday life. But if all that is true, why do writers and creators lean on the same tropes over and over again? And why are the weakest tropes in a piece of fiction often strange takes on women’s bodies, minds, and lives?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with comedy writer Hallie Cantor and comedian/actor/writer Tiff Stevenson for a look at fascinatingly dumb pop culture tropes about women. From movies to TV shows to video games, they’ll reveal common entertainment myths from “water breaks like a flood” to “women are the hardest thing to draw” to “your number of boobs indicates your morality.” They’ll also run through real-life casting calls with bizarre expectations about who exists in the world, look at how pop cultural sexism and real global sexism feed into each other, and mull how Listeners Like You can push all this in a better direction.

              <itunes:summary>Cowboys might be the most iconic type of American. The hat! The pistols! The white man! THESE are the markers of a true cowboy, in our minds. But what if that’s one prominent myth about the Old West? And what if it's one member of a rogues' gallery of bullshit you’ve been told about life in the late 1800s west of the Mississippi River? On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, outlaw podcaster Alex Schmidt forms a posse with incredible comedy writers Jenny Jaffe and Elliott Kalan. They’ll gun down myth after Old West myth, drawing on everything from historical records to Jenny &amp; Elliott’s experiences creating an animated TV comedy set in cowboy times. They’ll also explore weird myths about our cultural myths, figure out which modern celebrity has the best outlaw name, and re-imagine what a great Western story can be.

              <itunes:summary>The Indiana Jones movies are true to life. Not about that specific guy being real, or about certain magical canon being real, or about the archaeological profession being a parade of sex ’n Nazis. Still, here’s what ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ and its ilk get right: archaeologists dig up crazy nightmare horrors OFTEN. So on this spooktacular episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt joins Jason Pargin (who writes for Cracked as David Wong) for a trip through the astonishing horrors found by actual real-life archaeologists, because that stuff is much scarier and more fascinating than any horror movie. Listen for the terrifying Aztec death whistle! Discover the ancient cave that devoured a guy! And gain a stronger sense of how pants-crappingly awful the past was (and how lucky we are to be in the present).

              <itunes:summary>Wealth. Power. Enormous boats. These are just some of the markers of “elite” status in America. Populist candidates win race after race by running against Those Darn Elites. But what if that’s a fake difference? What if the “elites” are merely people who like information? And what if the “populists” are even richer and more affluent than the democracy nerds they keep running against? Most importantly: what if misunderstanding "elitism" in 2020, just like we all misunderstood it in 2016, could continue to screw the whole world up?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by journalist/comedy writer/author Joel Stein. They’ll explore the facts, figures, and freaky rural Texan crafts businesses from Joel’s new book ‘In Defense of Elitism: Why I'm Better Than You and You're Better Than Someone Who Didn't Buy This Book’. Find out why Trump voters can’t be defined as “poor and uneducated”. Find out how the creator of ‘Dilbert’ and the leaders of the #Resistance both went a little bit insane. And most of all, discover the actual political divide that decided the 2016 election (and may decide it again in 2020).

              <itunes:summary>“The empire on which the sun never sets.” That’s how the British Empire self-identified. In the 1910s, Britain ruled a quarter of the world’s people, living on a quarter of the world’s land. Do you know how Britain colonized places from India to Australia to most-of-Africa? Did you know the Empire ended within a few decades of its territorial peak? And did you know Alex Schmidt went to the U.K. recently, creating a perfect opportunity to dig into its fascinating history???




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt went through customs to tape in-studio in London. He’s joined by Cracked writer/editor Adam Wears, historian Dr. Charlotte Lydia Riley, and historian Dr. Kim Wagner for a journey through the British Empire’s bizarre, brutal, accidentally-on-purpose rise and fall. They’ll also dig into the United States’ outlier status in that history, explore ways the British Empire never stopped colonizing the world, and consider how Being The Most Important Empire Of All Time (According To Britain) might’ve driven Britain insane.

It’s also a truer, cooler, more incredible story if you stop and smell the roses...and in this metaphor, “the roses” are little-known bizarre stories from the lives of great scientists. On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedians Robin Ince and Olga Koch for a special LIVE show at The London Podcast Festival. They’ll explore the weirdest things you never knew about scientific luminaries from Newton to Darwin to Pythagoras. They’ll welcome further tales of that stuff from our brilliant British audience members. And stick around after the live conversation for a tale of perseverance through military occupation, heinous sexism, and more common historical obstacles, illuminating more things worth remembering as we examine odd men of the past.

              <itunes:summary>Many science fiction stories go to the past, not the future. Which makes sense, right? Why be a Connecticut Yankee in some random Jetsons city when you can be a Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur’s Court, A Place That’s Part Of Your Own Era's Roots, Which Makes Visiting It Meaningful? We all long to vacation in the past, touring its wonders before the germs &amp; backwardness bother us. But here’s one way being alive is more interesting than people think it is: there are a shocking number of artifacts that let you experience that past *today*, because they still exist in spite of all logic.




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with comedic character genius Andy Daly to bring the past to life. They’ll explore old curiosities that anyone can hear, see, experience, or eat, even though there is no way any of that should be possible. Join Alex and Andy for comedy records from 1899, pickles from before the Civil War, a surprisingly modern warning about a surprisingly ancient dog, and more.

That alternate historical premise might sound insane to you if you were born after the turn of the millennium. But here’s two things you Post-9/11 Babies may not know: “Y2K" was a big weird panic that’s funny in hindsight, and Iron Man used to be a niche unknown thing. Within the past 11 years, random comics characters like Captain America and a raccoon with a gun went from minor doodles to global megastars. And on this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by two full-on comics experts (Cracked’s own Cyriaque Lamar and comedy’s own Joey Clift) for a look back at how the dominant entertainment property of the 2010s sprang from one low-level Marvel employee and a whole bunch of lucky breaks. Discover the handful of left-field casting decisions, little kid focus groups, and Samuel L. Jackson dogged obsessions that sent billions of dollars flying in whole new directions and changed your past decade of moviegoing.

              <itunes:summary>If you lend a filmmaker your fighter jet, what do they owe you in return? Thanks to America’s military might and the world’s appetite for cinematic explosions, that weirdly specific question get asked a lot. Did you know the U.S. government influences dozens of movies and shows every year? Do you think Hollywood would pass up free Pentagon stuff to protect Hollywood's “artistic vision” for Transformers 8? And if you find out what the government cut out of movies and TV, does that tell you exactly what the government doesn’t want you to know?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Adam Tod Brown (Unpopular Opinion) and Nic Wegener (American Dad) for a look back at America’s strange history of government overreach into scripts, shoots, and entire concepts for movies and TV. You’ll discover which movies traded script control for Air Force gear, which entire TV era sold out to Big Anti-Drug, and the exact Defense Department policy on what the military does in an alien invasion.

              <itunes:summary>Empathy is down 40% among American young people. That’s the finding of a study analyzing dozens of other studies across decades of responses. That also sounds sort of insane -- if nothing else, empathy might not be something you think percentages can measure. But what if it is measurable that way? And what if poll responses about empathy, morality, and dogs in mortal danger open up cans of worms so enormous there’s no way to contain them in a single podcast episode?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (who writes for Cracked as David Wong) to explore a range of polls, studies, and self-reported opinions that say an insane amount about who Americans really are. You’ll discover the shocking estimated truth about America’s pornography habits, vaccine paranoia, faith in a higher power, and other critical factors that format society. Also get excited about wondering a whole new set of questions, covering everything from trolley problems to shower multitasking.

              <itunes:summary>Forty-eight people (and counting!) have been Vice President of the United States...and if you can name more than a few of them, you might love history as much as Alex Schmidt does. After all, VPs do a little-respected job that’s "not worth a bucket of warm piss.” And that’s not us saying that. That’s Vice President John Nance Garner (Veep #32) self-roasting with that. Still, look closer at that history, and you’ll find nine out of forty-eight VPs became the P. Nine out of forty-eight! 18.75%! Doesn’t that make every Vice President worth examination? Shouldn’t we pay them as much attention as their boss gets? Especially when the current Vice President is a secret maniac, with a shady past, and a little too much Garfield enthusiasm?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedy writers Broti Gupta (Speechless, The New Yorker) and Andrew Ti (Yo Is This Racist) for a look at baffling true tales of VPOTUS Mike Pence. Discover all the weird strange goofy things sprinkled throughout his past as a hot-take blogger, tobacco truther, campaign fund misuser, football game gaslighter, and other lousy things nobody has the mental bandwith to call him out on. Also stick around for the Dollar Store Machiavelli crap Mike Pence almost pulled to make himself your Commander in Chief at the last minute.

              <itunes:summary>You can have too much money. (Not YOU specifically -- you are a valued listener and deserve Scrooge McDuckian riches.) The world’s movie studios, TV networks, and other visual-fun production companies think they need an infinite budget to make the next 'Star Wars'-type cultural phenomenon. But what if we told them the history of film &amp; TV is packed with enormous successes that sprang from running out of money? And what if one of the prime examples of that is 'Star Wars' itself?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by working writers Hallie Cantor, Ben Joseph, and Chase Mitchell to see how the biggest movies and TV shows stumbled into great ideas by not being able to pay for their first idea. Discover which region-defining TV show was supposed to be set in the wrong city &amp; state, which British national epic almost had zero style, which defining film of the 1980s achieved greatness by lying to the cops, and so much more.

              <itunes:summary>Nothing says “summer” like a massive alien invasion of the planet Earth. Oh sure, that invasion never happens in life. But in movie after movie, space alien fleets descend on our little blue marble with intent to kill. Why do they tend to time that invasion with Northern Hemisphere summertime? Why are there so many common bonds between all alien invaders, even though the universe contains an infinite array of extraterrestrial possibilities? And how are audiences up for the same aliens losing the same battle every single movie?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked editor/columnist/human resistance leader Dan Hopper to wonder about that exact thing. They’ll explore the bizarre way alien blockbusters line up with each other time and time again. They’ll dig into basic strategic errors that hamstring the alien fleets, even though us much less advanced humans know better. They’ll also leave you with The Two Kinds Of Alien Movies, and a greater sense of why we fill multiplexes to see motherships laser our cities at all.

              <itunes:summary>Thought experiment: you're a large country locked in a 20th century geopolitical death struggle. Any wrong move could irradiate the planet. Any right move gets you a marginal victory over your opponent without ending the larger conflict. In that scenario, do you ease the root tensions driving the world insane? Or do you maximize those tensions, dig your heels in, and remake your entire society just to piss off the Rooskies? (Spoiler: you do the second thing and it becomes this podcast episode.)




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedian Chloe Radcliffe, comedian &amp; podcaster John Moe, University of Minnesota historian Elaine Tyler May, and an amazing LIVE audience at Amsterdam Bar &amp; Hall in St. Paul MN. They team up to explore the strangest, oddest, most bizarre ways America tried to win the Cold War -- everything from social engineering to suburban sprawl to a bomb shelter for non-human Americans -- and examine how those intentional societal shifts stick with us today.

              <itunes:summary>A “fire in the belly”: it’s a metaphor for motivation that sounds like terrible medical trouble. Our culture tells us a little bit of anger -- a little bit of that ulcerative-sounding “fire in the belly” -- helps us accomplish a little bit more. But what if that phenomenon can go farther? What if righteous anger led to some of the most impressive architecture, music, cartoons, and other great achievements of the past couple centuries? And what if the backstories there are hilarious every time?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedians Billy Wayne Davis and Rivers Langley for a look at the most incredible things ever done purely out of spite. They’ll dig into tales of 1800s tycoons, 2010s Vermonters, and other noted maniacs re-shaping our cities. They’ll explore how several of your favorite musicians made whole chunks of their catalog just to piss off the label. And in a final look at human motivation itself, they’ll put a microscope on the thin, blurry line between desire and fury.

              <itunes:summary>Aphorisms: they’re the world’s favorite way to let somebody else handle the thinking. We all turn to a time-tested saying or phrase from time to time. It’s not a crime or nothin’. But what if lots of our most common sayings have actual meanings that are the opposite of our intention? What if lots of our go-to words and phrases have nightmare historical origins? And when we find out our language has those dark secrets, what should we do next as responsible speakers?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt teams up with comedians Greg Edwards and Caitlin Gill for a trip back in time, back through vocabularies, and back to the basics of the English language. They’ll examine how history, slang, and surprising shifts in meaning can mess with our most trusted sayings and phrases, turning our ordinary speech into insane ahistorical nonsense.

              <itunes:summary>Over 2000 years ago, Aristotle wrote that it’s “evident” the Earth is round. One generation later, Greek mathematician &amp; geographer Eratosthenes achieved a solid ballpark estimate of the Earth’s circumference. Again, that was over 2000 years ago. So how are we now in a world where many people believe our world is flat? What if those Flat Earth People do believe in climate change, in a hilarious way? And is there any chance this is all the Internet’s fault?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Dana Gould ('The Simpsons', 'Stan Against Evil', incredible stand-up comedy, so much more) for a deep dive into the world’s strangest newest conspiracy theories. They’ll look at how YouTube, social media, and bizarre message boards give us rabbit holes like never before. And they’ll examine how you can move forward in a world where all data gets bent out of shape by people helping each other do it.

Yet if you talk about our future 50, 40, or even 10 years from now, people might tell you that’s fantastical wishful thinking. They may say the environment/politics/economy/incoming meteor dooms us all no matter what we do, so who cares. Why is assuming the world’s going to end so common? How come people talk about it with a wry jokey glint in their eye? And why does every generation tell that “joke” even though the world keeps on spinning?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (who writes for Cracked as David Wong) to dig into what you need to remember about our wretched hellscape. They’ll pick apart the fearful thinking that deactivates lots of people for no positive reason. They'll examine how people actually behave when the world actually is ending. And they'll explore the fantastic news that you’ll probably live to see a future Past You would kill for.

              <itunes:summary>In the 50 years after the Civil War, America’s population quadrupled. That’s right: four times as many people within five decades. That surge of humanity made the turn-of-the-century United States a nation of 75 million Americans flocking to cities built so fast some didn’t have plumbing. What if one of those cities (Chicago) installed its pipes after the fact by raising entire structures into the air like in a cartoon? What if America’s nationwide surge of urbanization led to a host of other problems almost too weird to contemplate? And what if our cities are full of smelly trees, gross traitor-statues, and more odd issues to this day?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedian Ryan Asher, journalist Maya Dukmasova, historian Jane Dailey, and an amazing LIVE audience at Lincoln Hall in Chicago IL. Listen to this Chicago super-team break down the animals, minerals, cartoon corruption and other problems plaguing America’s cities (in a fun way!).

              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>Movie sequels are the biggest gamble in entertainment. The first movie is the first bet: how much do you build it toward a franchise at the expense of its story? How many of those folks will stick around for a second adventure? With your Adventure #2, how do you retell Adventure #1's story in a new way? Those and more questions make it amazing second and third movies happen at all (let alone 20+ Avengers building blocks). But what if that sequel process isn’t as hard as it looks? What if it’s actually pretty easy to do...as long as you avoid a few classic pitfalls audiences reject every time?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt teams up with Cracked editor/columnist/swell fella Cyriaque Lamar for a look at mistakes multi-million dollar movie franchises repeat year after year. They’ll dig into the story problems studios keep bringing on themselves. They’ll examine why Aliens, Terminators, and more Hollywood big bads turn kind of lame after enough iterations. And stick around for a few movie franchises that nail this every time, in replicable ways (HINT HINT MOVIEMAKERS).

But what if that’s not the case? What if the art form of video games is a breeding ground for criminal activity? And what if the crimes are felony-level misdeeds, caused by everything from greed to malfeasance to Kate Upton’s chest? 




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Heather Anne Campbell and Nick Wiger, hosts of Earwolf’s upcoming ‘How Did This Get Played?’ podcast. They’ll combine incredible true stories with a deep knowledge of the gaming world to bring you gamer-based tales of theft, embezzlement, and biological warfare. Discover how millions of dollars, a slew of professional sporting events, and the Dutch Supreme Court changed forever thanks to the seemingly escapist medium of video games.

It was a time of lethal accidents, legal child labor, lecherous tycoons and more sick problems we've (mostly) left behind. Things got better in the past hundred years. That's a fact. But have things gotten better for you? Do you know working adults with benefits, unions, pensions, or any sense of a future? And most of all, if you hear somebody complain about their job, do you kinda think they're lucky to have a job at all?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (who writes for the site as David Wong) to dig into how modern work might be ruining your life. They’ll show the surprising life-or-death stakes baked into the simple question “how’s work?” They’ll also examine what science says about jobs of the future, how little science knows about jobs of the present, and how we can make each others’ jobs suck less by remembering the ways we’re the boss.

              <itunes:summary>If you ask the average American to name ten things from World War II, Benito Mussolini won’t often make the list. But “Il Duce” seized power long before Hitler, spent more than two decades reshaping Italy in his image, and coined that “Fascist” term we all yell these days. Isn’t it strange that we never focus on Mussolini when we hearken back to WW2? Could he be a useful historical touchstone for understanding the present day? And did you know modern Italy is so steeped in Mussolini, its rising political stars CELEBRATE his brutal genocidal legacy?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by historian &amp; scholar Ruth Ben-Ghiat and by comedian &amp; podcaster Adam Tod Brown. They're taking a timely look at the most ignored fascist government of all time. They’ll debunk common myths about Mussolini’s train-centric reign. They’ll reveal the shockingly brazen Mussolini acolytes in modern Italian politics, supported by Fascism’s soccer subculture and normalized legacy. Also stick around for the shocking parallels between 2010s world leaders and Mussolini’s 1920s quest to Make Italy Great Again.

              <itunes:summary>Notes are annoying. Nobody likes to spend weeks and months crafting an idea only to be told what’s wrong with it. Flip side to that: we often have blind spots when it comes to our creative projects. And that goes for everybody, even the creators of the most famous and successful entertainment of all time, because surprise -- almost every movie and TV show you love needed saving from creative notes that are (in hindsight) blisteringly obvious.




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked editor/columnist Dan Hopper and by writer/comedian Kandice Martellaro for a look at the most quotable, lovable, Oscar-winning movies of all time...and how they almost fell apart at the ideas step. They’ll also discover series-killing TV episodes that got rehearsed and staged and brought within a hair of terrifying America. And yes, don’t worry, they one hundred percent discover which iconic franchise almost made its villain a confusing monkey.

              <itunes:summary>Wars involve a lot of pressure to be cool. It’s why people sign up: the chance to be heroic, the chance to appear mighty, the chance to give a ‘Patton’ style speech in front of a giant version of your national flag. That heroic stuff is all well and good for the right cause. But what if that vibe hides the historical reality that thousands of years of wars often came down to goofy ideas straight out of a cartoon?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedians Logan Guntzelman and Eric Lampaert for a trip through the silliest, strangest, dopiest ideas that have ever won real battles. Discover world wars, civil wars, ancient bloodbaths, and other major conflicts that hinged on drugging honey, catapulting snakes, piling the right trash into the right boat-shaped pile, and other ridiculous "strategies."

              <itunes:summary>Conan O’Brien’s made 25 years of late night TV (and counting!). You probably know the support of a staff made that possible. But did you know it also took sprinting, packeting, Schwarzenegger-tracking, Central American kidnapping, index card pouch crafting, and more wild elements all coming together to make ‘Conan’ and its forerunners the comedy institution they are today? 




Answer: you did not know that, until you heard this episode of The Cracked Podcast! Alex Schmidt is joined by the multitalented Jessie Gaskell and Mike Sweeney: comedians, writers for ‘Conan’, and hosts of ‘Inside Conan: An Important Hollywood Podcast’. They’ll dive into how they got started, how late night shows function day to day, and surprising stuff from behind the scenes that you'd never know from watching at home.

              <itunes:summary>The phone you are reading this text on is easy to hold...if you’re a man. That’s according to statistics on average hand size &amp; average phone size. If you’re a woman? Good luck taking one-handed pictures on this slightly-too-big brick that might give you repetitive stress injuries men don’t experience. Of course a phone is merely a device (that you do everything in your life on). But what if there’s a mountain of data proving women get erased from all aspects of modern society, from design to media to medicine? And what if that erasure is a full-on life-or-death issue that (almost) no one is talking about?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by journalist, activist, and author Caroline Criado Perez. They dive into an array of facts, figures, and critical lacks of data, all gathered in her amazing new book ‘Invisible Women: Data Bias In A World Designed For Men’. They’ll also explore the conscious &amp; unconscious biases that drive women out of the workforce, swing voters into screwing over their own countries, and cause massive problems we could fix with a little more awareness...and maybe even a modest investment in studying human organs besides the penis.

              <itunes:summary>Novelists are a little bit invincible. Oh sure, it’s hard to write a book, and you are required to stop writing your book if you die. But barring that untimely demise, you can to see your novel through to the bitter end as long as you have enough grit to get there. What if a writer didn’t get to do that? What if you built out a narrative for tens of millions of fans, only to have a couple of executives tell you it’s over before anything resolved? And what if that “what if” describes the actual experience of making many TV shows?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by working TV writers Ben Joseph and Chase Mitchell for tales of TV cancellations that turned stories into madness. They’ll dig into TV’s distant past and recent hits for narratives that became baffling cliffs audiences fell off of, all because the network felt the show wasn’t selling enough soap.

You would think this revolutionary shift would make our lives less spooky. But what if we told you history is full of mysteries that received diligent investigations, only to turn up stranger scarier questions?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by writers/comedians/history mystery superfans Jenny Jaffe and Carey O’Donnell to rediscover history’s strangest disappearances, murders, and more. They’ll explore all kinds of baffling tales that confounded professional investigators from the past through today. And stick around for some plain ol' fun new theories on these old cases.

              <itunes:summary>We’re fresh off ‘Green Book’ achieving its dream Oscar night (CONGRATULATIONS you made-up Hero Dad Story you!!!). But this week’s episode is about EVERY Oscars ceremony. Why? Because the Oscars dictate most of your movie-watching year: October-December = “good movies”, January-February = “failed attempts at good movies”, summertime = “movies seeking the big green Oscar better known as MONEY.” So we asked ourselves a question. We asked what might happen if the Oscars stopped dictating that schedule? And what if they stopped dictating it because the Oscars stopped happening at all, freeing up all of pop culture to function differently (and maybe function better)?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, please enjoy the oracular brilliance and Hollywood wisdom of comedians/podcasters Caitlin Gill, Dan Hopper, Amy Nicholson, and Danielle Radford, who joined Alex Schmidt for this LIVE episode from the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. They’ll dig into the biggest possible pop culture thought experiment: what would happen if the Oscars went away.

              <itunes:summary>The most successful people in the world are SO EXCITED to call themselves that. Hard-charging, in-leaning, unstoppable titans of industry want everyone to know it. One of their favorite brags: never sleeping more than a few hours a night. Is that actually a cool thing? Should all of us let ourselves get talked into that lifestyle? And are a bunch of our daily habits that kind of smart-seeming bad health trap?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (who writes for the site as David Wong). They want you to hang in there, friend. If there’s one takeaway from today’s episode (and there are so many more than just one!) it’s that you oughta receive all the healthy support you can get from others and from yourself. Other takeaways: an immense range of fascinating facts about our bodies, our culture, and the war they’re in at all times if we’re not careful.

              <itunes:summary>History is the most prolific screenwriter of all time. Thanks to the magic of Events Happening In Real Life, pop culture has graced us with everything from ‘Braveheart’ to ‘On The Basis Of Sex'. Those hit biopics about real people form a sort of Humanity Hall Of Fame. What if we told you there are an endless number of incredible real people who belong in that hall, and could make Hollywood fat stacks of cash in the process, if somebody would only put them on screen?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by writers/podcasters/all-around hilarious people Dave Schilling and Andrew Ti. They’ll take a trip down historical memory lane, and look into the most fascinating stories of right now, to find every amazing biopic Hollywood should have already made (and still can make). Get to know the most incredible war hero and U.S. Senator nobody talks about, the first female Presidential candidate, the Forrest Gump of relationships with modern terrible men, and more epic real people with Oscar potential.

              <itunes:summary>“The book is better than the movie.” It’s a belief as old as...well, not as old as time, because books are centuries old and movies hit their stride when ‘Star Wars’ came out. Still, lots of people think movies ruin books. Many people also think there are one or two times when the movie outdid the book, in a weird exception-to-the-rule type situation. But what if we told you a better movie happens often? And what if there are cases where it was so obvious, to everyone involved, the book’s author said so? In public and everything?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by working writers Zack Bornstein (Saturday Night Live, Jimmy Kimmel Live, The New Yorker) and Hallie Cantor (Lady Dynamite, Arrested Development, The New Yorker) for a trip through the heads of novelists who saw their work torn apart on screen and realized it was for the best. Get excited to see Stephen King, Anne Rice, Philip K. Dick, and more great writers experience the joy of collaboration with Hollywood, in spite of the conventional wisdom we’re all told in English class.

              <itunes:summary>“Social atomization” is a term that sounds like science fiction. It could be the title of a 1950s B-movie where a mad scientist vaporizes a dance party. But when sociologists use that term, “social atomization” is a complementary set of shifts you might have noticed lately: more loneliness, less societal trust, and an increasing feeling that nobody’s got your back. What does it mean if that’s happening to all of us? How can that happen without anybody intending it? And can that impact everything from your personal health to your national government?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (who writes for the site as David Wong). They’ll explore why prior generations with rampant crime (!), Richard Nixon (!!), and the music of disco (!!!) feel better off and more cohesive than we do today. We’ll also take one step back and look at the awful reasons why some people are talking about this in the first place. And if we all stick together and trust each other, we might see a few ways out of this predicament.

              <itunes:summary>We are fresh off the longest government shutdown in American history (with another around the corner, maybe!). We are also riding almost a decade of of sustained stock market growth, almost a decade of sustained job growth, and all kinds of other business-y news you heard about. And when those stories crossed your cable TV screen or Twitter feed, did you have any idea what they meant? And if so...c’mon, are you sure you’ve got all the context?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Kai Ryssdal, the host of ‘Marketplace’ and the world heavyweight champion of that exact economic context you need. They’ll dig into how just one missed federal worker paycheck (let alone two!) ripples through the global economy for a long time. They’ll examine ways you can better understand what a stock market swing or jobs number actually means. Also stick around for valuable heads-ups on which chairpersons, directors, and CEOs tend to be extremely important indicators of our economic future, even though most people pay them no attention.

[TIMELY UPDATE: on Friday afternoon the U.S. government re-opened temporarily. Details here: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/us/politics/trump-shutdown-deal.html We will describe the shutdown as a present-tense thing in this episode because, as we’ll say early on, we taped this episode right before the government re-opened. Also we taped with that possibility in mind, so all our facts about the shutdown are accurate and are long-term focused.]</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>You’ve probably heard jokes about lawyers before. Here’s a more advanced version, coming from future Chief Justice Of The U.S. Supreme Court John Roberts in April of 1983: “The generally accepted notion that the court can only hear roughly 150 cases each term gives the same sense of reassurance as the adjournment of the court in July, when we know the Constitution is safe for the summer.” We know, we know, it’s not exactly a kickass one-liner. But what if it is getting at something true about the U.S. Supreme Court’s overwhelming power? What if our whole Constitution can vanish because five out of nine Justices get a little too active? And what if Chief Justice Roberts is a perfect example of the inconsistent, insensitive, inscrutable jurists who’ve hamstrung American democracy for centuries...all without most people noticing?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Ian Millhiser, author of the book ‘Injustices: The Supreme Court's History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted’. They’ll re-discover the forgotten SCOTUS decisions that endorsed everything from racism to sexism to wildly villainous child labor. They’ll explore the complicated make-up of today’s Court, with a view to how its faults could destroy it. And great news: they’ll celebrate the rare past SCOTUS that got a whole lot of things right, and look at how that golden era could happen all over again.

              <itunes:summary>The name “science fiction” is a pretty good descriptor of the genre, if you want to think of it as two big buckets for a writer to fill. Bucket 1: science! Fun tech and gizmos to entertain and inspire. Bucket 2: fiction! Narrative and story and other engaging ideas that make us laugh, cry, and consider what it means to be human. It’s amazing that one genre can bring us all that. But have you ever noticed some sci-fi does an incredible job of the “fi” part -- and thanks to that brilliant “fi”, we let a lot of weird “sci” whoosh right past us?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Dan Hopper (Cracked) and Moujan Zolfaghari (Mission To Zyxx) for a trip down memory lane, into the future, where everybody WISHES they had tech half as great as WiFi. They’ll examine everything from ‘Minority Report’ to ‘Blade Runner’ to all generations of ‘Star Trek’, finding gizmo after gizmo that’s lower-tech than what we have in real life, and dig into why sci-fi stories where things are supposed to be more advanced than today ignore the actual ways technology advances.

              <itunes:summary>How well do you read Latin? Because if you’re not all that good at reading Latin or other dead languages, good news: you could have still had a job as an 1800s historian. Fun example: there’s a story claiming the Roman emperor Caligula was SO CRAZY, he sent a whole army to a beach to pick up seashells for him. However, the Latin word ‘musculi’ means both “shells” and “military huts”, so he likely actually told his troops to pack up their campsite. Which is normal. That’s a completely different kind of emperor, right? And here’s a fun thing: your pop cultural understanding of the Roman Empire is approximately that far off of the truth, in a lot of fascinating ways.




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Siobhan Thompson (CollegeHumor, BBC America) and Patrick Wyman (Tides Of History, ‘Jeopardy!’) for a trip through the inaccurate lies you’ve been fed about the ancient Romans, and also the much more interesting true things you never knew about them. Get your head straight about everything from mighty gladiators to ancient fast food to the stunning economic benefits of living near a former Roman road.

              <itunes:summary>“No bad ideas in a brainstorm.” That’s a common saying that implies a darker truth: as soon as an idea leaves a brainstorm’s cocoon, and gets put into practice, it can metamorphose into a living, breathing disaster. After all, who knows how your theoretical idea would actually work? How can we put any idea into practice without testing it on millions of people first? And surprise -- sudden mental left turn here -- what if we already had a way to test all kinds of ideas, see how great they really are, and then easily make your life better by implementing them?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Adam Tod Brown (Unpopular Opinion) and Nick Wiger (Doughboys) for a worldwide brainstorming session. They’ll consider all kinds of real ideas, tested by real countries, that could upgrade life in America if we just had the courage to borrow them. The year’s almost over, so throw on some headphones and find out how copying the best laws from Sweden, Cuba, Taiwan and more places could be our first and best decision of 2019.

              <itunes:summary>You’re holding a couple hundred billion transistors right now. Yes, you. You with the smartphone in your hand. That’s possible because -- surprise -- transistors are only a few nanometers in size now. A size so small, that description means nothing to you, right? Well here’s something: what if transistors and all other things we engineer are only going to get smaller from here? And what if that entire process began a shockingly short time ago, in a specific place, and changed the entire world faster than anybody realized it was happening?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by author Simon Winchester. His latest book is ‘The Perfectionists: How Precision Engineers Created The Modern World’, and he &amp; Alex will explore exactly that. They’ll also get into why 1776 should be famous for more than the American Revolution, why Eli Whitney should be famous for being a con man, how the Hubble Space Telescope got itself contact lenses, and more shocking tales of precision changing the entire world overnight.

              <itunes:summary>Space: it’s the final frontier AND somehow the least popular frontier. A couple decades of successful shuttle launches passed unnoticed. A slew of orbital science experiments didn’t excite anybody. Even the Space Race wasn’t the nation-gripping drama we decided it was retroactively. Why isn’t space travel capturing more imaginations? Why aren’t people more stoked about it? And would it help if we did a rad podcast episode about the most kickass exploits in all of space history?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by ‘American Dad’ writer, Cracked legend, and prince of all our hearts Soren Bowie for a celebration of outer space heroics. They’ll dig into the death-defying (and sometimes, death-receiving) bravery that’s driven decades of space exploration, even though only a few of those bold explorers became famous in the aftermath. Plus, enjoy a special bonus story of how the very best of us went out into the universe in the form of a space probe.

              <itunes:summary>Here’s some common sense: the more complicated a machine gets, the more ways it can break down and fall apart. That applies to everything from cars to kids’ toys to Hollywood, and that last thing (Hollywood) is this principle’s most fun application. Because what happens to your favorite movie if any step of the process goes differently? Is it even still that thing you like if it has different writing/casting/directing/editing/releasing/endless continuing list of these things?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by podcasting titan Matt Gourley for a deep dive into all the ways our favorite franchises could’ve come together completely differently. From James Bond to Star Wars to even bigger pop cultural touchstones than those (!), they’ll discover how close we came to not even recognizing the movies, TV shows, and other entertainments closest to our hearts.

              <itunes:summary>History: it’s the number one topic for filmmakers who want to win an Oscar. From serious movies about American history to serious movies about British history, no subject wins more votes and locks down more statues. Of course the people making those movies would tell you they’re super serious because history was that way, so what else can they do. But what if every period drama could be funnier AND realer if it got over itself? And what if eras from ancient Rome to the twentieth century Cold War featured real hijinks that are so hilarious, so wild, so straight-up funny, Hollywood refused to show them to you?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt and Dan Hopper explore that exact phenomenon. They’ll pick apart some of the greatest historical dramas and biopics of all time, take you behind the production curtain, and pick out the hilarious elements filmmakers just didn’t have the guts to put in. And they’ll dig into the biggest historical events of all time, illuminating funny real things no moviemaker would show you unless they’re making a comedy, and willing to forgo Oscar riches.

              <itunes:summary>Our brains have a few sets of guardrails...theoretically. One set should prevent us from claiming wild nonsense about ourselves, in particular if we know we can’t back it up. Another set ought to prevent us from falling for that garbage if other people pull it. But what if certain people don’t have that first limitation? What if they have the ability to lie beyond all reason, all the time? And what if the rest of us are liable to fall for it in spite of ourselves?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Danielle Radford and Jenny Jaffe for a trip through ridiculous lies and cons that never should have worked...and somehow fooled everybody anyway. They’ll explore historical and modern-day examples of utter shenanigans happening everywhere from Brazil to Paris to the Dominion of Melchizedek (don’t ask). And they’ll mull why people love perpetrating -- and falling for -- the dumbest tricks imaginable.

              <itunes:summary>Imagine a genie gave you one million dollars to make a movie. You’d immediately go into Working Your Ass Off Mode, right? After all, if you’re spending one whole million U.S. dollars, you’d want to make sure the script and production were as perfect as they could be. Now here’s the next version of that thought experiment: what if you got to spend FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS? What if you got to spend it making an Avengers story that tied together ten years of filmmaking? And here’s the scary part: what if your story forgot to make it clear that the villain was, ya know, on the wrong side of the conflict? 




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedy writers Chase Mitchell and Ben Joseph for a look at how some of the biggest movies of all time forgot to prove that their villain was in the wrong. And if they’re lucky they’ll find a way to explain how films from ‘The Little Mermaid’ to ‘Mission: Impossible - Fallout’ to ‘Avengers Thanos-stravaganza’ screwed up the basic building block of "good versus evil" without audiences noticing.

              <itunes:summary>If you took an advanced high school history class, you might remember that The Spanish-American War happened. You might even remember a few details: a ship sinking in Cuba, the U.S. taking over Puerto Rico, Teddy Roosevelt riding a horse...and once you answered a couple test questions about that, you moved on forever. To most people, the wars that define America involve George Washington winning, Adolf Hitler losing, and the Russians pointing nukes at us and frowning. But what if a brief American conflict in the year 1898 did just as much to shape the entire world’s destiny? And what if people of that time knew their votes in a few key elections would make all the difference?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Stephen Kinzer, author of ‘The True Flag: Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain, and the Birth of American Empire’. Alex and Stephen dig into The Spanish-American War, and why it’s the most important American war nobody in America ever thinks about. They’ll look at how a little-known U.S. Senator, an even lesser-known populist silver freak, and the legacy of the Spanish Inquisition shape all our lives today. And they’ll consider how modern voters could finally answer the question of what America is supposed to be in the world, and answer it in a way where everybody benefits.

              <itunes:summary>Thought experiment: imagine an alien. Great, experiment complete. Now examine what you came up with. It’s almost definitely one of two things: 1) a specific extraterrestrial from a movie or show, who you can point to as from that movie/show. 2) what’s known as a “Grey” -- a small humanoid with a large teardrop head and two face-dominating eyes. That second kind of Grey Alien dominates our cultural conception of life from other planets. But where did it come from? And what does it say about our larger belief in everything from dragons to werewolves to the scariest monsters ever invented?




On this spooktacular episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (who writes for the site as David Wong). They’ll dig into the creepiest “true” story Jason’s ever encountered. They’ll also explore monster lore from the Salem Witch Trials to Slenderman creepypasta to the myth of The Deep State. And they’ll consider whether all monsters, human and otherwise, come from a cultural &amp; psychological source that’s scarier than anything you could dress as for Halloween.

              <itunes:summary>What do you do when a piece of entertainment lets you down? Maybe you complain about it to your friends. Maybe you nail its flaws with a sly tweet, or share a damning critical review. If you use any of those forms of outrage, it's probably because failed art can feel like it's happening TO us, not for us. But what if we told you anybody can take ownership of their viewing experience? What if holding one fun idea in your mind throughout an okay movie can change it into unforgettable entertainment? And most amazing of all: what if that could make ‘Star Wars’ prequels kind of watchable?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedian writer &amp; memoir-master Guy Branum for a celebration of fan theories, head canons, and other ways to read a movie better. They’ll re-discover everything from Julia Roberts’ heyday to Disney’s darkest hour. They’ll turn football movies into the Shakespearean tragedies they’ve always been. And if they can find the strength to do it, they’ll make ‘Entourage’ into something miraculously watchable.

              <itunes:summary>Books: they’re almost definitely supposed to do something besides decorate wall space. After all, there’s a whole class about them every year in school. Also various scientific studies say our brains get concrete benefits from reading the written word. But what do we gain when that word is read to us? What do we gain when we let a writer’s meaning reach us like never before? And what happens to society itself when literature takes on the role of prototyping our future?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with the one and only LeVar Burton, host of the incredible ‘LeVar Burton Reads’ podcast. If you’ve watched TV in the last 40 years, LeVar’s gotten you excited about books directly (‘Reading Rainbow’), indirectly (the original ‘Roots’ TV adaptation), and science fictionally (decades of ‘Star Trek’ acting and directing). Today he and Alex explore how the world’s reacted to LeVar's unique literary mission. They’ll also walk through a history of science fiction prototyping, the near future of ‘Trek’ storytelling, and what literacy can do for all our futures if we let it.

              <itunes:summary>Television: it’s the most important art form that’s ever been shot with a gun by Elvis. And don’t let that jokey reference to a real thing (seriously -- check the footNOTES) distract you from our current Golden Age Of Television. We have more shows, and more great shows, than ever before. But has the system for rewarding those shows kept pace? Do we have the right set of Emmy Awards for celebrating TV’s new best stuff? And if a panel of comedians put their mind to it, could we get a new set of awards that are the silliness America needs right now?




On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is LIVE at UCB Sunset with an all-star panel of comedians &amp; TV writing pros. Join Demi Adejuyigbe (The Late Late Show, The Good Place), Haley Mancini (The Powerpuff Girls), and Dana Gould (Stan Against Evil, The Simpsons) for a celebration of everything TV can be...and everything funny about TV that The Official Emmys are too staid to have a laugh about.

              <itunes:summary>Fandom: it feels like it’s gotten hard lately. For example, ‘Ready Player One’ began its life as a bestselling novel by Ernest Cline. In their “A”-graded write-up in 2011, The AV Club said "for readers in line with Cline's obsessions, this is a guaranteed pleasure." Yet by 2018, when ‘RPO’ got a Steven Spielberg film adaptation, that same review site gave the movie a “B” grade with a side of savage criticism: "Like Ernest Cline’s divisive geek-courting novel, the film doesn’t offer much of a story or characters, instead spreading out an endless buffet of pop-culture references, flattering the preoccupations and encyclopedic recall of its target audience.” Does that make any sense? Was aggressive fandom better a few years back? Or has the dark side of really liking a thing turned too dark, too often?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedians Caitlin Gill and Riley Silverman for a range of stories about how to be the absolute best pop culture fan you can be. They’ll focus on tales of fans connecting with creators, changing the shape of their favorite art, and putting themselves into it. They’ll also mull the dark side of intense fandom. And with everything from ‘Doctor Who’ to ‘Spider-Man’ about to premiere new installments, they’ll point to how you can be somebody who makes the world of fandom brighter.

              <itunes:summary>Have you visited America’s heartland? And if you have...why are you so sure? “The heartland” is not a defined thing, with borders or flags or land made of literal hearts. The term actually comes from a British geographer named Halford Mackinder (a fantastic name), who coined “heartland” in 1904 to describe one central part of pre-WWI Europe. So why do we use “heartland” in the present day, to describe an aspect of the U.S.? Is it to imply ideas about it, without letting you consider those ideas on their merits? And are there other words in our language that get used the same way?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (better known as David Wong) to explore the most celebrated words in the English language that also trick us constantly. They’ll examine how throwing around the term “real” messes with everything from our gender roles to our dinner plate to our politics. They’ll uncover the creepy way certain words throw entire generations under the bus. And they’ll explore why philosophies like socialism and fascism are making a comeback in places like America’s Heartland (whatever that is).

But in terms of taking your brain over by manipulating it with song, they’re the world’s foremost masters of a little trick called the appoggiatura. What is that magic Italian-derived word? How does it work? And how many other ways does the world prank your brain with music every day?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Jamie Brew (Botnik, Clickhole) for tales of tuneful brain trickery. They’ll dig through the latest brain science, the biggest pop songs of today, and the history of opera for ways your noggin hears music and messes with you as a result. Also, this one has some fun musical examples! So how about that!

              <itunes:summary>Movies have a weird double standard when it comes to character deaths. Some characters get swelling music and emotional final speeches; others get blown to bits in some background CGI effect intended to slightly increase the stakes of the second act. Strangely, this is even true in movies specifically about the sanctity of life, like &lt;i&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/i&gt;. Why is this? And is it getting worse?




Today Alex is joined by Cracked contributor Dan Hopper and writer/performer Kandice Martellaro to dissect a bunch of famous movies (even some good ones!) that are weirdly callous about people dying horrible, gruesome deaths.

              <itunes:summary>Did you know you can get paid to be a fake mourner at a funeral, for families who fear a low turnout? Or to pretend to be a fan of a celebrity, to make them seem more popular at appearances? If you have the right look, you could even get a job as a fake businessperson in China, for companies who want "Americans" in the background of their press conferences. 




These are just a few of the bizarre but very real jobs covered in the Personal Experiences section of Cracked, along with things like "Spice Merchant", "Professional Drug Test Subject" and "Human Hair Collector." Today, we're talking to Cracked contributors Evan Symon and Isaac Cabe, who've spent years tracking down and talking to people who work jobs that are weird, fascinating and almost totally overlooked.

              <itunes:summary>When you fire up Netflix, you’re looking at it...and it’s looking back at you. Which is weird, right? Even though you already paid for Netflix’s entire service, and even though it shouldn’t matter to Netflix how you spend your time there, every image you see is calibrated to sell you what they’ve decided you want. Did you know that process is going on? And did you know they might know some things about you that’d surprise you?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (better known as David Wong) to explore Jason’s latest column, their shared Netflix histories, and what that system means for every one of us. They’ll examine the burgeoning new-ish field of data science, its laughable limitations, and its about-to-explode future. They’ll dig into businesses that already stick entire segments of the population with lousy choices, just because the businesses decided those people are A Specific Segment. And they’ll consider the inevitable world of number-crunched choices we could all get stuck with if companies don’t treat us like actual people.

              <itunes:summary>You need to arm yourself against weaponized old tweets. Not your own tweets, hopefully (though who knows). We’re talking about how every time you open social media, someone’s outrageous words are being used against them. Maybe the frequency of that scares you; after all, every one of us is lucky certain things we’ve said weren’t timestamped for eternity. Or maybe that pile of outrage excites you; justice relies on evidence, so maybe the more evidence there is the better the world will get. But take a look past all these maybes and semicolons (we know we used a lot; we feel fancy today, deal with it). Look at what's actually going on with Internet outrage right now. Is all that handwringing the same across the board? Or is some of it intended to ruin lives just to win a political game?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Amy Nicholson (Unspooled) and Andrew Ti (Yo, Is This Racist?) for an always-timely look at how you can tell worthwhile online activism apart from digital harassment. They’ll examine recent cases from James Gunn to Sarah Jeong to Roseanne Barr. They’ll lay out basic rules of thumb to help you handle the next hashtag that comes along. And they’ll find a fuller answer to all this than Twitter users usually can, thanks to the magic of being human toward each other in more than 280 characters.

              <itunes:summary>The stock market is even more powerful than you realize. Which is saying something, right? Much like Han Solo is pretty sure he can imagine infinite money, you believe you know the world’s combined wealth is mighty. But did you know a lot of Traditional Upstanding Stock Market Business is simply rich people gambling? And did you know individual rich people, regular people, and even children have steered the entire world economy into a ditch more times than your history teacher can count?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Gaby Dunn for an adventure through modern risk-takers, historical bet-losers, and the creepy way wealthier people are keeping you unaware of the whole thing. They’ll rediscover Scotland’s canal through Panama. They’ll watch entire stock exchanges and currencies collapse because of one guy. And they’ll leave you with ways you can be just as powerful as those mysterious masters of the universe if you think a little bit more about where your money lives.

              <itunes:summary>We live in an era of permanent reboots. Everything from ‘Superman’ to ‘Archie Comics’ comes roaring back in one form or another, because we entered a handshake agreement with capitalism that we would pay to see it. You may know a few things you like had a weird sequel or two. But did you know almost every franchise has experimented with going completely off the rails, in public, often with added talking animal friends?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Kristi Harrison and Cyriaque Lamar for a trip through the world’s favorite pop culture, and the bizarre mutations it went through without most people noticing. Discover the truly weird true ambitions of the artist behind ‘Garfield’, the movie studio behind ‘Casablanca’, and every cartoonist who tried to make ‘James Bond’ and ‘The Flinstones’ work for modern kids.

              <itunes:summary>Believe it or not, Abe Lincoln was a real person. Oh sure sure, he SEEMS like a kindly freedom-giant of the mythic past, who strode out of the fog and into kicking Robert E. Lee’s butt. But isn’t it more interesting if he was a real guy? Heck, isn’t it more interesting if EVERY past President was an actual human being, with dreams and sicknesses and fixations like anybody else? And strangest of all, what if the elaborate myths we build around POTUSes are both untrue AND the least interesting thing about them? 




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Elliott Kalan (MST3K, The Daily Show) for a deep dive into the fake facts you’ve been told about Presidents, and the more incredible real facts you deserve to know. Find out why James K. Polk was like Pinhead from the ‘Hellraiser’ movies. Find out how Calvin Coolidge (a very talkative person) revolutionized Presidential communication. And stick around to discover which POTUS wanted to capture a living woolly mammoth, haul it to D.C., and show it off to the Europeans.

              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>The US-Mexico border is many things: a line on a map, a setting for ‘Sicario’ movies, a heinous crime scene. North America’s most famous border is so prominent in our minds and our hearts, it’s easy to forget it’s also a place most of us have never been. Do we really understand what it’s like down there, or has it been misrepresented by every anti-immigration “tough guy” we see on TV? Is it really the unique migration crisis we think it is, or are other countries’ borders even deadlier flashpoints? And most surprising of all: what if that potential wall that dominated the 2016 election ALREADY EXISTS, and has existed for over a decade?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Dr. Reece Jones, a scholar who literally wrote the book on our modern violent borders. They’ll draw on Dr. Jones’s experiences at walled borders from Arizona to Morocco to Bangladesh (fun fact: some “fences” sure are wall-shaped!). They’ll explore 230-plus years of predatory &amp; inconsistent American migration policies. And you know those Executive Branch photo ops where Fearless Leaders examine Strong Border Walls that Make Us Stronger? Turns out they’re even more full of crap than you think they are (and we say that knowing you can imagine a lot of crap).

              <itunes:summary>As long as real-life gun rampages go unchecked, first person shooter video games will be a major battlefront of The Culture War. After all, today’s new hyper-realistic gun games must be causing today’s hideous violence! But what if twenty years of perfecting virtual headshot tech dovetails with a drop in American violent crime? What if games don't actually trick anyone into being violent, or sexist, or an Italian plumber? And most chilling for you gamers out there: what if games DO trick you into becoming a less ideal person, in a way nobody’s ever warned you about?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Jason Pargin (better known as David Wong) to explore a surprising truth nobody else is covering. They’ll combine decades of gaming experience with a range of studies and reporting. They’ll debunk a lot of the panic about Those Darned Violent Video Games, while also picking out some truths hidden in it. And they’ll explore how gaming DOES change the brains of even the most blood-averse n00bs.

              <itunes:summary>We live in exciting times, other than all the reasons we don’t. Why’s that? We live when TV shows got good. Over the last 15-20 years, high quality television became a normal thing there’s almost too much of, instead of a rare jewel hiding in a sea of cranked-out, time-constrained filler. But how did we reach this pinnacle? What failed experiments laid the groundwork for our present nirvana? And did Kanye West really get to create and film TWO entire TV show ideas in 2007?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Dan Hopper (Cracked) and Chase Mitchell (The Tonight Show) for a look back on the most bizarre decisions in TV history. They’ll uncover pilot episodes that boggle the mind, baffling ideas that ran for multiple episodes, and entire plotlines on massive hit TV shows that happened for idiotic reasons. They’ll also break down the process that turns one idea into 24 episodes. And if you’re patient, they’ll share with you the wonder that is BAYWATCH NIGHTS.

              <itunes:summary>Freedom: it can be the noblest-sounding justification for bailing on stuff. And it’s as American as the Pilgrims, who escaped persecution in England by going to the New World (so they could persecute themselves for a change). Of course, life today is much different: the oceans are mapped, the First Amendment protects all our religions, and Thanksgiving is a minor holiday setting the stage for Black Friday. But what if we told you that the impulse to Mayflower away from the rest of us is stronger than ever, and weirder than ever, with a dark secret most people don’t notice?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked’s Kristi Harrison for a look at two broad movements that want to move the hell away from the rest of us. They’ll dig into why a floating libertarian paradise and an ahistorical “Western” culture obsession can spring from the same impulse. They’ll uncover how both groups are built on hopes that practices like voting, women’s suffrage, and gay rights might go away. And they’ll affirm why you don’t need to build your own survival bunker or boat just because all the other kids are doing it. And Alex &amp; Kristi will affirm why you don’t need to build your own survival bunker slash boat just because all the other kids are doing it.

But what if we told you that some of Hollywood’s most celebrated characters were the product of actors goofing off, performers being themselves, and/or directors tormenting people into insanity? And what if we told you ONLY SOME of the examples of bizarrely real acting involve Adam Sandler???




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is LIVE at UCB Sunset with Dan Hopper (Cracked, CollegeHumor), Molly Lambert (Night Call, NYT Magazine), and Dani Fernandez (Nerdificent, Geek &amp; Sundry) for a look back on amazing performances by actors who weren't acting. Find out how Oscar-winning directors, world-famous thespians, and sneakily-aimed vomit cannons combined to make the biggest movies of all time more real than you ever imagined.

              <itunes:summary>Are you 100% sure you exist? Good news: we’re sure. But here’s a few TERRIFYING headlines saying otherwise: “The universe shouldn’t exist, according to science.” (New York Post) “The universe shouldn't exist, scientists say after finding bizarre behaviour of anti-matter” (The Independent) “Universe shouldn’t exist, CERN physicists conclude.” (Cosmos Magazine) You might see those statements and think they sound increasingly convincing. First it was scientists saying stuff, then they brought anti-matter into it, and then holy cow here comes CERN. What a big official-looking acronym! 




All those stories spring from one study, which Physics Today and Gizmodo covered in a professional way. The study explained a huge leap forward in how we measure antiproton magnetic movement. One press release about it contained a borderline joke about the universe. And from there, all hell broke loose. Specifically, the same hell that keeps happening with discovery after discovery.




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Matt Kirshen (The Jim Jefferies Show) and Andy Wood (Bridgetown Comedy Festival) of “Probably Science” to plumb the depths of Internet science reporting. They’ll explore the food chain of scientists, universities, PR people, clickbait farms, and straight-up liars who turn good science into confusing Facebook junk. They’ll rolodex tales of alien octopuses, brown pandas, new Earths, and other actually-awesome things you’ve been lied to about. And they’ll send you out into the world with science literacy tools that will make your brain happier and your life a whole lot easier.

              <itunes:summary>Soccer: it’s the sport the rest of the world calls “football”, despite how loud America yells otherwise. It’s also the global obsession that peaks every 4 years with a World Cup. This year’s Cup is about to start in Russia. 2026’s Cup is about to get awarded to the United States and Canada and Mexico, maybe. And everyone is abuzz about which of the perennial contenders (minus Italy, minus the Netherlands) will win it all. That passion for the game means big crowds, big glory, and big money. But did you know it also created the world's most brazen white collar criminal organization? And helps past and present autocrats keep their stranglehold on power?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Dr. Natalie Koch (Maxwell School at Syracuse University) and by DeMorge Brown (Harmontown, Channel 101) to explore how soccer’s governing body became a secret Swiss crime family without most fans noticing. They’ll find insanely bold sports corruption everywhere from Qatar to Trump Tower. And you’ll discover how soccer, the Olympics, cycling, falconry, and more global sports take our planet’s politics in a weirdly dark direction while also bringing joy to our planet’s people.

              <itunes:summary>The 1st Amendment: it’s America’s most cherished and well-defended constitutional freedom that's not that gun one. Either way, we’re used to living in a country where free speech has few limits, and only really runs into trouble when it can get people killed. But what happens when that free speech lobbies for white supremacist ideas that have historically caused violence and death? What happens when that speech comes in the form of text on websites, days after an awful tragedy? And what happens when a couple of random tech bros hold the power to boot that speech off the Internet on a (morally defensible) whim?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by NPR’s Sam Sanders for a fun look at the strangest phenomenon of the past few months. Drawing on legal experts, tech thinkers, and one hard-to-stomach interview, they’ll explore how a few people now hold the keys to our entire public square. And even though you’re (probably) not a creepy jerk hiding out on EvilFrogTwitter.biz, get ready to consider whether the Internet freedom you love has ever existed at all.

              <itunes:summary>Food: you gotta eat it. No matter how you organize your diet, habits, and beliefs, you’re going to devour something that other people helped put in front of you, every day. And don’t get us wrong: eating is awesome. But did you know it’s also a lot more fascinating than you ever realized? Did you know you’re in a world where cheese is a conspiracy, fish are a lie, and every bit of the world’s honey WILL NEVER DIE?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is LIVE at UCB Sunset with Hallie Cantor (Arrested Development, Lady Dynamite), Brodie Reed (Channel 101) and Ian Abramson (Oddball Comedy Tour), exploring bizarre secrets of the foods we eat every day. Find out how wood found its way into...everything. Discover which common nut explodes without warning. And sit down to your next meal with a heady appreciation for the phenomenally weird process that puts those nutrients in front of us every day.

              <itunes:summary>How much do you know offhand about World War II? If you’re an American, you probably know a lot. After all, everything from our education system to our popular culture hammers home the key facts of The War To End All Wars For Real This Time. And congratulations: a lot of what you know is factually accurate (e.g. “Hitler was bad”). A lot of what you know is worth knowing (seriously, Hitler was VERY BAD). But have you ever wondered why certain historical specifics get so much emphasis, while other facts get left by the wayside? Or why the name “Hitler” pops up in modern debates about everything from immigration to environmentalism to upsetting blog posts?




On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt and Jason Pargin (better known as David Wong) look back on the defining war of The American Century, and examine the bizarre ways it gets reinterpreted through the years. They’ll get into the geopolitical reasons why movies like ‘Patton’ and ’Saving Private Ryan’ celebrate some men and not others. They’ll consider the legions of historical monsters we ignore (or even laud!) in the process of cartoon-ifying World War II’s struggle. And maybe, just maybe, if enough people hear this show, not every random modern thing will get called “Hitler” without deserving it.

              <itunes:summary>“Avengers: Infinity War” is like the Super Bowl: either you saw it, or you consciously opted to miss America’s latest biggest cultural event. But football is niche compared to MARVEL MOVIES. They’re the biggest pillar of global entertainment, made by skilled professionals doing their very best work, and here’s the weird fun thing about all that: the comic books themselves started weird, got weirder, and stayed baffling throughout our modern day.




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked editor Cyriaque Lamar for a journey through decades of comic book insanity. Find out how Marvel, DC, and independent publishers have cranked out almost a century of baffling storylines and irresponsible canon changes, even as those same characters have conquered TV and film. And go out into your world knowing you live on a planet that once featured Werewolf Captain America, Badminton Champion Batman, and a friendly neighborhood Planned Parenthood Spider-Man.

              <itunes:summary>“Hollywood” might be the most nebulous entity in America. It’s somehow a location and an industry and a big goofy hill-sign. It’s the source of all entertainment without entertaining us very often. And it’s where budding young artists flock to make it “big” (in Schwarzenegger’s case, literally). In popular consciousness, Hollywood is a sea of countless artists making our culture. But what if we told you the music world, movie world, and more pillars of American fun are driving by a shockingly tiny number of artists? And even weirder, the key artists are people you’ve never even heard of?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt and special guest Jensen Karp (Get Up On This) celebrate rappers, writers, filmmakers, and wrestlers who remade our entire culture without the wider public knowing it. They’ll rediscover a comic book artist who resurrected Princess Di. They’ll champion the mid-1990s bodybuilder who reinvented rap. And because everybody needs a little care right now, they’ll grief-counsel themselves AND you through the end of Kanye West.

              <itunes:summary>Here’s a mental experiment: think about “The Middle East”. What just popped into your head? It’s probably one or two kinds of places, tops. It might be a dangerous war zone, or a community that’s somehow hundreds of years behind modern life. And it definitely didn’t include skiers, on an indoor hill, in one of the world’s largest malls. 




No judgments here, friend: we all have misconceptions about the world. And some of your Middle Eastern mental picture may be accurate. But what if we told you there’s an entire world of big box stores, Lionel Richie fandom, and intricate cultural diversity out there just waiting for you to discover it?




On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt joins Anna Hossnieh &amp; Shereen Younes for a revealing trip through the modern Middle East. They’ll dig into how how two rival Muslim-majority nations manipulate the entire region, why there’s all kinds of Middle Eastern modernity the American media misses, how a World Cup bid caused an international blockade, and so much more.

              <itunes:summary>If you look back at old Westerns, you might see “Indians” portrayed like senseless alien villains. If you go back through O.G. ‘Twilight Zone’ episodes, you’ll find a lot more Christianity than today’s pop culture fans are used to. And if you watch ANYTHING from the 1940s that involves marijuana, get ready for hilariously over-the-top scaremongering about the lethal horrors of jazz cigarettes. Now consider this: all that past pop culture seems strange now because it drew on the most forceful beliefs of its time. So what the heck is going to happen when OUR grandkids watch, stream, and play through the biggest hit pop culture of 2018?




On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, we’re predicting that exact thing. Alex Schmidt is joined by Jason Pargin (better known as David Wong) for a future’s-eye view of the movies, TV, video games and other fun we all love today. Discover the blind spots that lead modern America to root for secret police, demand the sloppiest possible leadership, live in eternal terror of somebody breeding plants better, and hold even more baffling beliefs beyond those.

              <itunes:summary>Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai often tells a story about a hummingbird. In the story, the hummingbird’s forest catches fire. It’s burning out of control. And while the larger stronger animals cower, the hummingbird flies back and forth, putting drop after drop of water on the blaze. The big animals ask the hummingbird why it’s trying to put the fire out, since it seems too little and small-beaked to accomplish anything. The hummingbird’s simple reply: “I am doing what I can.”




On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, we’re turning a listener suggestion into a joyful hummingbird hour. On the heels of our latest episode indexing little-known badasses of history, Alex Schmidt and Kristi Harrison are celebrating little-known badasses of life right now. Find out how Los Angeles priests, Turkish garbagemen, Japanese scuba enthusiasts and more regular folks are spreading their little wings, picking up their water drop, and finding out just how big of a fire one hummingbird can fight.

Zak breaks down the entire chain of events, revealing new details about the shrimp fried rice caper’s victim &amp; perpetrator.

              <itunes:summary>Spring is upon us. And spring is like a starter pistol for the annual sale of 72 million major league baseball tickets all across America Plus (“America Plus” is our fun brand name idea for The United States + Toronto). Whether or not you like baseball, you know it’s been the United States’s national obsession for over a century. But what if we told you baseball is ALSO a fascinating Rosetta Stone-like guide to a slew of bizarre truths about America? And what if we told you those truths might blow your mind EVEN MORE if you DON’T follow the game?




On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedian/writer/TV show creator Rhea Butcher and Cracked editor Dan Hopper for a deep dive into American culture, economics, morality, and awesomeness, all through the surprisingly revealing lens of Major League Baseball. They’ll tackle the racist 20th century cartoon that 21st century kids love. They’ll reveal how your tax dollars go into your nearest big city rich guy’s pocket, thanks to Congress’s ongoing bipartisan support. And they’ll rolodex the drugs, imperialism, sausage races, and goofy scooters that make America’s pastime as uniquely baffling as America itself.

              <itunes:summary>Everyone has dreams of greatness. Some hope to be important leaders. Others hope to break barriers and change peoples’ lives. Still others want to be war heroes with superhuman Rambo-like invincibility. Well the cool thing about history is that it’s full of those leaders, pioneers, and supersoldiers -- all you gotta do is look closely. And the even cooler thing about it is that history is so chock full of badasses, one great American was a “leader/pioneer/supersoldier” rolled into one, and lived in our lifetime.




On this week's LIVE episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedians Emily Heller (Conan, Late Night with Seth Meyers), Greg Edwards (The Improv, Wisecrack) and Zack Bornstein (SNL, The New Yorker) for a sequel to one of our all-time favorite Cracked Podcast episodes. You’ll discover over a dozen incredible humans from across a thousand years of human civilization. You’ll come across women &amp; trans people who HIS-tory should’ve celebrated sooner. And for the first time ever in our “little-known badasses” series, you’ll hear the tale of one hero who’s a panelist’s ancestor.

              <itunes:summary>If 'The Prestige' hamfistedly taught us anything, it’s that movies are big ol’ magic tricks. Lights shine on a screen, colors dance in front of our eyes, and we feel like we went to space...even though we’re still sitting in that movie theater in Glen Ellyn, Illinois that we walked into two hours ago. And the biggest trick of all might be how much baffling universe-building washes over us as we watch. Like in ‘Liar Liar’, why is Jim Carrey’s son a god? In the ‘Indiana Jones’ franchise, how is every god real? And according to Actually Oscar-Nominated Film ‘The Boss Baby’, is human history a nightmare psy ops forever-war?




On this episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Dan Hopper (Cracked, CollegeHumor), Dave Schilling (Bleacher Report, Grantland), Amy Nicholson (Variety, Earwolf's The Canon), and a live UCB Sunset audience, for a deep dive into some of the biggest movies ever made. Find out why there are secretly terrifying characters and plotlines in everything from Star Wars to Wonder Woman to the finest film ever made (i.e. The Emoji Movie).

              <itunes:summary>If you’ve never received a free lunch at school, you’ve avoided the most persistent and institutionalized form of bullying in American society. Because that food that doesn’t cost money DOES cost a level of shame that other kids don’t have to experience. It’s also shame that’s often coming from official school rules, doled out by authority figures, because our society has low-key written that into law. Which begs the question: why are we dunking on our own poor kids, when they never asked to be born into that jam?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt gets to sit down with Jason Pargin (better known as David Wong) and with John Cheese, for a look at how and why America’s arranged itself to make sure poor people feel that way every day. They’ll also look back on Jason &amp; John’s shared Midwest childhood, explore the idea that destroyed Newt Gingrich, and discover why everyone from people to monkeys freak out in a rigged system. And good news: they’ll find a way we can all make life better for every American.

              <itunes:summary>If recent interviews with music legend Quincy Jones are any indication, every famous musician hangs out with every other famous musician (and yes, we know Quincy Jones also said......other stuff). Which kind of makes sense, right? Once you’re in that upper echelon of winning Grammys and living in the Hollywood Hills, you’d probably at least run into each other at whatever the rich people equivalent of 7-Eleven is (8-Twelve?). But here’s the amazing thing: a lot of those hangouts almost led to bands and team-ups that would’ve changed the course of music history.




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Jack O’Brien and Miles Gray (The Daily Zeitgeist) for a reunion of sorts, as they mentally reunite music legends who almost built mind-blowing awesomeness together. And we’re not just talking “the Beatles do more stuff” awesomeness. We’re talking “Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix and Miles Davis BECOME A BAND” AWESOMENESS.

              <itunes:summary>If your politics lean left, your trusted pundits are telling you THIS. IS. THE. YEAR. when our disastrous political situation will turn itself around. “Robert Mueller’s closing in on Trump! The American people are starting to wise up! A midterm election Blue Wave(TM) will #Resist the #NotMyPresident into #DrumpfDefeat!” Well what if we told you none of that will happen without a herculean effort on the part of America’s decent people? What if we told you none of this will get fixed soon? And what if we reminded you those same pundits who think everything’s about to be fine LITERALLY LAUGHED at the prospect of a Trump presidency not that long ago?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedian/soothsayer Adam Tod Brown (Unpopular Opinion Podcast Network) for a deep dive into the history, technology, and basic math that proves we are nowhere near getting out of the woods yet. They’ll look ahead to what might actually happen by the end of this midterm-riffic year of politics. And they’ll help us all preserve our mental health by setting reasonable expectations, instead of assuming we’ll be saved by the total nonsense hopes of pundits on TV.

              <itunes:summary>If you tuned into The Super Bowl, The Tonight Show, or mainstream radio this month, you experienced America’s most bizarrely fascinating celebrity. That celebrity is Justin Timberlake. He’s spent the past year or so carefully turning himself into “Justin Timberlake, Montana Cowboy”, and that seemingly random choice WOULD be fine, if not for these three things: 

1) The transformation’s only Instagram-deep. 

2) White men across America are doing the same thing. 

3) The reasons behind these white fellas running west aren’t as simple as musical taste/cheap land.




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt interviews Montanan slash culture writer Anne Helen Petersen about her pioneering examination of The West, our celebrities, and why they’re hiding there. They also break down the myths of the Old West, the realities of why modern white people are flooding it, and why being a “Man Of The Woods” is no substitute for engaging with reality.

              <itunes:summary>They say the past is a foreign country. (Trust us, it’s a saying!) What they leave off in that aphorism is the fact that the foreign land of Past-zakhstan is a foreign country of constant pranks and goofs. From 1950s America to Renaissance Italy to the Norman conquest of England, our ancestors were all about changing the world AND yoink-ing each other every step of the way.




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt is LIVE at UCB Sunset with comedians Caitlin Gill, Christine Medrano, and Blake Wexler. They’ll run down the all-time silliest nonsense of actual human history. And the audience joins in at the end with some historical pranks and goofs of their own, because our live shows are interactive and fun like that.

              <itunes:summary>Monty Python once taught us the following neuroscience: “The human brain is like an enormous fish. It is flat, and slimy, and has gills through which it can see.” That obvious bullshit is obvious bullshit. It’s also not much sillier than our own daily treatment of our brains. We know the human brain needs calm, care, and interaction with other humans. So why don’t we give that to our gilled head-fish?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to rediscover brains and the humans carrying them around. They’ll get into why this is the era of bombarding our minds with Snapchats, sleeplessness, and incomplete friendships. They’ll explore the fundamental feedback loops that make us seek out bad habits. And they’ll pick out how you can be aware of your own mental health needs, even if our wider culture wants to trick you into forgetting all about them.

              <itunes:summary>In the year 2050, there will be 10 billion people on Earth. Or at least that’s the scientific estimate. Sounds like a giant human milestone, right? Well IT TOTALLY IS…assuming we harvest 50% more food than we are now, to feed those people. Oh and 4.5 billion people will be short on fresh drinking water by 2025, 1.2 billion people are short on electricity right now, and global temperatures are about to rise a degree Fahrenheit or two (or 8.1, turning most of the world into a desert). So…where do we go from here, Earth?




Well on this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with science/history/everything about life on Earth writer Charles C. Mann. They’ll explore the lives of Norman Borlaug &amp; William Vogt, the title “characters” of Mr. Mann’s new book The Wizard and the Prophet: Two Remarkable Scientists and Their Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow's World. We’ll also uncover photosynthesis’s stupidity, nail down climate change’s branding, and look back on hundreds of years of human self-improvement that suggest we might just make it to 10 billion if we pull it together.

              <itunes:summary>If there’s one book the entire planet wants to read right this second, it’s ‘Harry Potter and the Eighth Novel That’s As Good As The First Seven’. So far J.K. Rowling hasn’t given it to us, because she’s been TOO LAZY (and when we say “too lazy”, we mean she’s written a play and a movie franchise and adult novels and good tweets). So what if someone else could replicate her work, and write us more Potter? Also what if that writer was a machine? And what if that machine delivered utterly brilliant scene descriptions like “Ron was going to be spiders. He just was.” that made us realize how funny Harry Potter oughta be?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with Jamie Brew, Elle O’Brien, &amp; Mike Frederickson, a team of comedians &amp; tech wizards from Botnik. They’ll dig into how Botnik’s predictive text technology combines with actual living breathing humans, to find fun jokes within the relentless advance of automation. They’ll also discover a digital future that might actually be worth looking forward to. And they’ll even deliver The Cracked Podcast’s first ever dramatic literary reading.

              <itunes:summary>You are a human being. Which means "you" are actually one human plus the trillions of microscopic life forms living in you. And "you" are living in a civilization that's only had microscopes since the 1670s, and only begun to understand what microscopes reveal. And "you" are living on a planet that was dominated by microbial life for about half its natural history, with more complex species only showing up in the last quarter, like a Miami Heat fan in between South Beach clubs. Which all begs the question: is this the microbes' world, and we're just living in it? And what does that mean for us as a species?




On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt sits down with science journalist Ed Yong (The Atlantic) for a look at the incredible world of microbes we've been living in this whole time, covered brilliantly in Ed's book I Contain Multitudes. Find out how trillions of tiny bacteria &amp; germs guide everything from your nutrition, to our psychology, to the evolution of life on earth itself.

              <itunes:summary>Bill Murray is an asshole. Or at least his “Ghostbusters” character is, if you consider the environmental ramifications of keeping a box of evil ghosts in America’s densest square mile of humans. That d***less EPA guy was right. Times changed. You know that. But did you know actors from Tom Hanks to Jimmy Stewart ran into that same Murray Problem? And played villains who seem nice, or heroes who seem like garbage people, just because the whole world changed a few decades (or years (or seconds)) after the movie wrapped?




On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked editor Dan Hopper for a journey into the dark underbelly of almost all your favorite movies. From the Christmas classics you love to the superhero movies you plunk down $17.50 to see, get ready for the history, economics, societal shifts, and scams the President of the United States got away with, that turned your DVD collection into a set of ridiculous movie premises.

Well what if we told you that while that was often true, there were squads of highly-motivated nice people standing up to the Nazis marching in the streets? And what if we also told you they stood up to those Nazis with the funniest, pinkest, fundraising-est pranks imaginable?

On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by comedian, Southerner, and friend of the show Billy Wayne Davis, for a happy stroll down recent memory lane. They’ll discover magic t-shirts, “Swiss Coffee”, alien beings, and more fun ways the forces of good are kicking ass, taking names, and playing a little sousaphone along the way.

              <itunes:summary>On June 27th, 2003, a $6 million movie premiered at two theaters in Los Angeles, earning a reported box office gross of less than $2000. That movie was called THE ROOM, and against all odds it became a midnight screening sensation, changed the way the entire world watches movies, and made an enigmatic fake New Orleans native into the most successful unsuccessful director in Hollywood history.

On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Scott Neustadter &amp; Michael H. Weber, screenwriters of the new (and high quality!) movie THE DISASTER ARTIST. Find out how a movie based on a book based on a film production slash friendship became a universally meaningful piece of drama, while keeping in every open door, ass shot, and demented line reading that makes THE ROOM a legend.

Probably stuff like ‘Saturday Night Live’, ‘The Daily Show’, John Oliver, network late night shows? Well if you look back over that list, you probably won’t find anybody who’s not openly lefty liberal (hi Stephen Colbert!) or wonky liberal (hey Seth Meyers!) or dead-center apolitical (hello Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader!). Why is that? How is there a total lack of high-profile comedy platforms that cater to the Mitt Romney supporters of the world, let alone the Trump zombies?




On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Jason Pargin (Cracked) and Zack Bornstein (SNL, Jimmy Kimmel Live) for a look at how comedy works, who’s allowed to be our leading joke-tellers, where today’s comedy comes from historically, and why Jimmy Fallon lost a third of his audience by treating Donald Trump like a regular guy one time.

              <itunes:summary>Growing up: it used to be as easy as drinking your milk, preparing to work 1 job for 40 years, and not misusing the height of telecommunications (a landline phone). Now that all of that has changed (side note: turns out milk isn’t all that good for you), what should we be teaching the new generation of kids about life on Earth? Also, hold on, we’ve all seen the Internet. Maybe the adult generation is the one that actually needs the advice.




On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Kristi Harrison (Cracked) and Andrew Ti (“Yo Is This Racist”) to explore every lesson that ought to join the pantheon of Things We Tell Kids About Life. Find out why you might not be apologizing very well, why your retirement plan might be a mirage from the 80s, and most astonishingly, why Kim Kardashian and Guy Fieri are f***ing awesome.

              <itunes:summary>Thought experiment time: what's the best episode of your favorite TV show? No matter what the series, from Mad Men to Seinfeld to Battlestar Galactica, it's a surprisingly hard question to find an agreeable answer. But that's what we've assigned Cracked's resident TV nerds, Carmen Angelica and Brett Rader, with doing: each week they're going to look at a different popular TV series and try to determine its best episode ever. In the past two weeks they've discussed Friends and Adventure Time, and this week, as a special bonus for Cracked Podcast listeners, we're posting their discussion about 30 Rock.

              <itunes:summary>The news: if you’ve read it since the fall of 2015, it’s been nothing but Donald Trump stories, and Opponent Of Donald Trump stories, and the sports section (which is also kind of Trump news). That’s insane, right? Isn’t there an entire rest of the world out there, full of local governments legislating, scientists discovering, rich people hiding money on tropical islands, and woolly mammoths dying in slapstick ways? Ya know, the fun stuff?

On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, we're LIVE from UCB Sunset in Los Angeles, with guests Cody Johnston, Katie Goldin, Rivers Langley, and Siobhan Thompson. And we're bringing you all the amazing, terrifying, and strange news the media hasn't had the bandwidth to tell you about.

              <itunes:summary>Top 40 radio: it’s like if a robot became obsessed with our collective subconscious. And it’s always been dominated by fun, sunshine-y pop songs. Stuff like “Respect” (Aretha Franklin) and “Hey Ya!” (OutKast) and “Maniac” (that dancing movie). But are those songs all that they seem to be? Or do they have hidden, fascinating meanings that nobody ever stops and thinks about?

On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Howard Kremer and Kulap Vilaysack, the hosts of Earwolf’s “Who Charted”, to ask the questions nobody’s asking about the biggest hit songs of all time. Get ready for a whole new perspective on all your favorite artists, from Van Halen to Marvin Gaye to Francis Scott Key.

If only that first episode aired-- it would've been a cult phenomenon-- an all-time pop-culture "what-if?" But instead we got LOST-- the time-traveling, island-hopping sci-fi adventure of diminishing returns.

On this week's podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Carmen Angelica and Brett Rader, the two hosts of Cracked's newest podcast series Best Episode Ever, to talk about 10 innovative TV pilots that almost made it to series but will forever be "what-ifs."

              <itunes:summary>Stop me if you've heard this one before: a charismatic populist leader rises to power by warning of immigrants who are are "filthy" and "bring disease." It's no coincidence the greatest deplorable leaders through the ages use the same coded language to talk about people who are "other."

It's psychology. Quite understandably, it's human nature to fear disease. It's why rats are icky to us and I ceremonially burn my clothes after I go to Disneyland. But if you know what you're looking for, you'll see how diseases are are framed as exotic and foreign as an excuse to gang up on different nationalities: SARS, ban Chinese people; Ebola, ban everybody from Africa; sickness in general, build that wall.

On this week's podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to talk about how this weird germ theory controls how you think about everything.

              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>Whether it's ghosts or the afterlife or god, most humans tend to lean towards thinking something funky and unknowable is out there, even if they can't pinpoint what it is or prove that it exists. 

With ghosts, this seems to be especially true. In some states, real estate listings must disclose if people have died at the property, you know, in case ghosts, and even the most fervent atheists will admit, "yeah there's something weird opening doors in my house, it's definitely a ghost."

On this week's episode, Alex Schmidt is joined by Dana Gould, creator of IFC's Stan Against Evil for a wide-ranging conversation about why humanity is obsessed with the supernatural and some of the scientific reasons our bodies trick us into believing that ghosts are real.

              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>Aside from a couple original standouts, horror movies seem to trot out the same 5 or 6 monsters/killers/haunted board games each year. It's The Fourth Life-Partner of Chucky (they're not putting labels on things). Saw 3.14: Circular Saw! Oui-3: Revenge of the Ouija!

The 'Saw' joke isn't even a joke. The 8th 'Saw' movie is coming out this year. There are no remaining Hollywood actors who haven't been murdered by the Jigsaw killer.

To end the stale repetition put forth by the horror industrial complex, Alex Schmidt is joined by a panel of Cracked's David Christopher Bell and Brett Rader, as well as comics Hallie Cantor, Greg Edwards and Danielle Radford to talk about 15 real life urban legends and folk monsters that deserve their own horror franchise that runs about four films too long.

              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>In an alternate 1985, American movie audiences saw a movie called Spaceman From Pluto, wherein Eric Stoltz's time-traveling DeLorean is sent back to the 80s by driving straight into a nuclear explosion -- nuke the fridge style.

Almost as if the writers and producers had time traveled themselves to watch Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and realized what a horrible idea that would be, Stoltz was recast, the title was changed to Back to the Future and Marty McFly gets back to the future by summoning 1.21 gigawatts through the power of lightning.

This is just one example of how studio notes aren't always a bad thing. On this week's episode, Alex Schmidt is joined by The Canon's Amy Nicholson to discuss how movies like Alien, Forrest Gump, and Beverly Hills Cop were saved, or almost completely ruined by the scourge of Hollywood: studio notes.

              <itunes:title> Which City is the Number 1 Movie Setting of All-Time?</itunes:title>
              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>New York. Paris. Tokyo. Miami. Even if you've never been to these cities (and sometimes, even if you have) the visions that come rushing to your mind at the mere mention of their names are images from movies. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton on a park bench in front of the Queensboro Bridge, Scarlett Johansson wandering through Shibuya Crossing, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy doing Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy things in a boat on the Seine.




It's a cliché, but certain world cities become characters in the movies in which they are set. And sometimes, **cough cough Judd Apatow**, movies are just set in the Los Angeles suburbs for no discernible reason other than the actors and director didn't want to travel very far to get to work.




On this week's podcast, inspired by and recorded in New York, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked's Daniel Dockery, Brett Rader and Michael Swaim, as well former Cracked columnist Cher Martinetti, to discuss their 9 favorite movie locales and lay a city-sized crown on the one they think is the best place to set a movie.

              <itunes:summary>Hey there, you awesome person you! Congratulations: you’ve survived several months of a Donald Trump presidency. And double congratulations: you’re pushing through this dark period despite having to experience it with a human brain. Our brains feel stress about everything from large predatory animals to low smartphone battery levels. Which begs the question: isn’t it worth wondering how those fragile organs are handling American history’s Dumbest Timeline?




On this week’s episode of The Cracked Podcast, Alex Schmidt brings in Cracked POTUS-trackers Cody Johnston and Sean “Seanbaby” Reiley to discover the scale of President Trump’s towering horses**t, and the psychological ramifications of facing it day to day. They’ll shine a light on the most staggering, pointless lies ever told by the Commander in Chief. They’ll use the latest psychological studies to examine how constant chief executive lies can scramble our brains. And they’ll wrap up with ways you can be more mentally resilient than ever, both now and through the “The Rock” Johnson Administration.

              <itunes:title>The Terrifying Truth About Why We Love Apocalypse Stories</itunes:title>
              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>​From Mad Max to The Road to the illustrious career of Roland Emmerich, it's clear that the modern pop-culture consumer loves apocalypses. Climate change and the threat of nuclear war or worldwide super-virus make imagining an apocalypse easy. And if you look back through history, it's obvious that as long as there has been civilization, there has been the fear of complete and utter worldwide destruction.




One of the most prolific names today in speculative fiction is N.K. Jemisin. The first two books of her Broken Earth trilogy have won the Hugo Award for best novel the last two years consecutively. If you want to read the best sci-fi about the apocalypse, you need to be reading N.K. Jemisin's books. 




That's what we did, and N.K. Jemisin was kind enough to join Cracked's Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim in New York for a conversation about world-building contemporary sci-fi, some of the most interesting real-life apocalypses in human history, and the difficulties of writing end-times fiction when the world so often is stranger and crueler than fiction.

              <itunes:summary>If you're a movie fan in 2017, you're hard pressed to find many original sci-fi films. There are a lot more Alien: Covenants and Blade Runner: 2o49s than Ex Machinas. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just sometimes sci-fi fans want to experience something new, something fresh, something that's not in the Transformers expanded universe.




I mean, it's 2017. There are new planets and technologies being discovered every day. Surely some of them would make for the basis of a good sci-fi movie.




So on this week's podcast, Alex Schmidt puts together a panel to research as many new and groundbreaking science stories as possible and pitch them as sci-fi movies. He's joined live in New York at the Now Hear This podcast festival by Cracked's Brett Rader and Michael Swaim, and comedians Claudia Cogan and Negin Farsad to discuss sense vests, head transplants, robot vines and more.

              <itunes:summary>Another summer in the books, another summer of somewhat pleasing comic book movies. Wonder Woman was good! So was Spiderman! Guardians of the Galaxy was...a movie! What's next? Oh no. Don't say it. 




Justice League. [cue the sound of failure from The Price is Right]




All we're saying is there are tons of great indie comics and obscure graphic novels that would make awesome movies that aren't necessarily about super-powered people. So that's what we're talking about on this week's podcast.




Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked's resident comic experts Michael Swaim and Randall Maynard to pitch movie versions of 11 of their favorite un-adapted comics, including the Jodorowsky/Moebius collaboration that Luc Besson should've made before Valerian, a graphic novel that's Casper the Friendly Ghost meets Lord of the Rings, and the Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead) series that should get a adapted next.

              <itunes:summary>If car commercials, beer commercials and presidential stump speeches were the only entertainment you consumed, you'd probably be pretty bored. You'd also think that American farmers are the life-blood of the economy and account for roughly 85% of the population. But in fact, less than 2% of Americans work in the business of putting food on your table-- we're talking farmers, ranchers, fishermen, etc.-- and over 80% of us live in metropolitan areas of some sort. That's a crazy ratio, especially when it comes to something as important as where the next meal is coming from.




How did we get here? How has the food industry in America gone from family farms and self reliance to drive throughs and endlessly stocked supermarkets in just a couple hundred years? This week, Alex Schmidt and Carmen Angelica speak to Maureen Ogle, a historian who wrote a whole book on the nuts and bolts of the American food industry and specifically, our obsession with meat.




Neither her book nor this podcast are condemnations of eating meat or exposés into the horrors of meat production, we're just taking a look at the amazing confluence of business, agriculture, science and logistics that keeps the grocery shelves stocked and the McRib in rotation.

              <itunes:summary>Jonny Sun is Twitter-famous. Not in a Lady Gaga or Justin Bieber sort of way. He's Weird Twitter-famous. He's got half a million followers and he did it the hard way, by inhabiting the character of Jomny Sun, an alien visiting earth without any friends or a solid grasp of spelling in the English language.




Jonny's now a published author, a playwright and an architect, he's coded two of Twitter's most popular bot accounts, oh, and he's studying for his doctorate at a little place called MIT. Heard of it?




Dude is super smart, super funny and while normal people like us have to practice and study to get better at things, he probably learns like Trinity in The Matrix learning how to fly a helicopter. So this week Alex Schmidt and Daniel O'Brien are joined by Jonny in-studio to talk about his book full of typos, juggling being an author-internet celebrity-architect-playwright and the state of internet cultures in 2017.

              <itunes:summary>​Imagine you're just living your normal life, walking down the street and WHAM-- a car slams into a traffic light and the driver bails out from the cabin, firing machine guns and rocket launchers at everything in sight. The police arrive at the scene, engage in a bloody firefight and eventually a high-speed chase. But, once the suspect leave their line of sight, they just sort of...give up.




You are an NPC (non-playable character) in the Grand Theft Auto universe, where the long arm of the law only reaches as far as the computer's AI will allow it and even getting arrested by the cops only means a couple of hours in jail and a couple hundred bucks coming from your pocket.




Fun world to live in as a regular-joe? Maybe. Depends on how much you value your life, justice and going bowling with your cousin.




On this week's episode of The Cracked Podcast, we think about the little people in our favorite video game universes. What would it be like to be an NPC in GTA, Red Dead Redemption and Sim City? Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked's Adam Ganser and Christian Ramirez, and comedians Mike Drucker and Monika Scott to figure out which video game universe would be the best to live in and which one would be the worst?




​Light bulbs stuck in butts! Heroin-induced erectile dysfunction! Trash cans filled with empty vodka bottles and sex toys!

              <itunes:summary>For years, Cracked's Personal Experience section has been home to some of the highest-performing articles on our site. We've interviewed doctors, former cult members, and basically every kind of prostitute imaginable.




Despite the success of these articles, there's been one thing we can't translate adapting our hard-hitting interviews into text on a screen: our subjects' voices. So, for the last year we've been secretly taping conversations to create a podcast version of our 10 favorite Personal Experience subjects, and that season 1 of that podcast is premiering this Wednesday as Cracked Gets Personal.




And this week on the show, Alex Schmidt is welcoming Cracked Gets Personal's hosts, Robert Evans and Brandon Johnson, for a discussion of how this mini-series came together, how the Personal Experience articles get written and how CGP deftly tackles the subjects of police brutality, the opiod epidemic and butts...lots of things getting stuck up lots of butts.




To catch the first two episodes of Cracked Gets Personal on Wednesday, August 16th search for it in your podcast app of choice or click here to subscribe on Apple Podcasts: https://goo.gl/cj7V5h

              <itunes:summary>Do you know what you want to do with the rest of your life? Well the good news is nobody really knows. You’re not alone! The bad news is you were supposed to know by age 13 or so. And if you didn’t know back then, society’s been watching you flail around ever since. We’re a nation of human beings, facing more change and “economic anxiety” than ever before. And if you look close enough, you’ll realize the answer to that problem has a lot less to do with border walls and coal jobs, and a lot more to do with welcoming immigrants, encouraging adaptability, and rethinking our entire educational system.

On this week’s podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Kristi Harrison, to point out our ongoing national crisis of mis-preparation derailing the lives of America’s teenagers, middle-aged parents, and everybody in between.

              <itunes:summary>Thanks to those plucky kids in Stranger Things and the larger proliferation of nerd culture, we're happy to announce that Dungeons and Dragons is officially cool now. And as with many things that are either retaining or finding success almost a fifth of the way into this new century, DnD is doing it by adapting to the times. Groups can now conduct entire campaigns online (no more meeting in mom's basement); YouTube, podcasts, etc. have created more DnD content than the average player knows what to do with; and the DnD-style role-playing game has expanded to multiple genres, so players who would rather walk on broken glass than participate in anything with the word "Dragons" in it, can play a comedy, horror or sci-fi RPG game.

DnD is so cool, its reach has expanded to prison, the coolest place. Yes, prisoners are playing DnD instead of dominoes or chess or the stabbing game (never heard of it? It's the game where you just stab people).

The reach and stature of Dungeons has expanded so much, after having our first African-American president and our second criminally insane one, who knows, in a few years, we may have our first president who goes by Zudlud Geodeheart, the Deep Gnome Barbarian. President Geodeheart could probably pass some healthcare legislation. 

On this week's podcast, Alex Schmidt is taking his great axe, 100 gold, and a poison resistance elixir around Los Angeles for a sort-of state of the state of Dungeons and Dragons. First, he's joined by Cracked's Michael Swaim to speak with Spencer Crittenden of HarmonQuest, and they talk about what it's like being one of the most famous Dungeon Masters in the world. Later, Alex speaks with documentarian Elisabeth De Kleer, whose viral article and video about prisoners who play DnD shines a humanizing light on how table-top RPG games can provide a therapeutic effect on the incarcerated and even patients with mental illnesses. Lastly, Alex sits down with Geoffrey Golden and Lee Keeler, who have adapted the cult-comedy classic "Wet Hot American Summer" into an RPG game coming out later this year.

              <itunes:summary>If sci-fi movies have taught you one thing about species with queen-based social hierarchies, it's that you should always kill the queen. Same goes for insects right? Kill the queen and the ant hill or bee's nest goes away. Sounds good, unless you're dealing with Argentine ants, who have about 300 queens for every 1,000 worker ants. 




How do you kill them? 




You don't.




Where do they live? Probably Argentina, right? 




Wrong, they've taken over just about every continent other than Antarctica. So good luck with your new insect overlords.




On this week's podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked's Katie Goldin and Daniel O'Brien, as well as comedians Joey Clift, Caitlin Gill and Matt Kirshen to discuss ants, crows, cats, immortal jellyfish and 7 other species whose crazy abilities will allow them to take over the world once us humans are gone.

              <itunes:summary>All the hip young kids are using a thing called the internet these days. In fact, if you're reading this summary or listening to this episode, odds are you're using the internet right now. But what if it all just went away? No podcasts, no turn-by-turn directions, no swiping for romantic partners, hell, most of us wouldn't even have jobs if there were no internet (see: everyone at Cracked).

It's an interesting thought experiment to...think about...and experiment on. What would you do for a living; how would you get by day-to-day without the comfort, the convenience, the necessity of the internet?

Alex Schmidt and Kristi Harrison ask the Cracked staff that very question in this episode. They chat with Abe Epperson, Tom Reimann, Ann Smiley, Saundra Sorenson and Brett Rader about the unthinkable--how could we live 21st century life without the internet?

In addition to new episodes of The Cracked Podcast every Monday and Kurt Vonneguys every third Tuesday, we're proud to launch Cracked Movie Club, which can be beamed directly into your earballs every Thursday.




Each month, your hosts Tom Reimann and Abe Epperson are choosing a new director and doing deep-dives into four of their films with some of your favorite comedians, writers and Cracked personalities. First director: Steven Spielberg.




To celebrate the launch, Cracked Movie Club is taking over The Cracked Podcast feed for the day so you can hear the inaugural episode. Tom and Abe are joined by comedian Daniel Van Kirk as they discuss how poisonous snakes, punishing desert sands, an outbreak of what can only be considered a modern plague, and a grown man pooping his pants all came together to create Raiders of the Lost Ark. Along the way, they question whether Jones was ultimately a better name than Smith, the logistics of maintaining a puzzle tomb in the middle of a jungle, and whether a certain Disney prince made a depressing cameo appearance.




And if one episode wasn't enough for you, chaos theory is working in your favor, because episode two is available right now. Grab some fossilized mosquitos, a tub of ice cream and strap yourself in with the two female ends of a seatbelt, because Tom, Abe and Cracked's David Christopher Bell dissect Spielberg's 1993 hit, Jurassic Park.




To hear episode two and get episode three the day it comes out, subscribe by searching for Cracked Movie Club on your podcast app of choice or clicking here to find it on Apple Podcasts: https://goo.gl/fQ2o72</itunes:summary>

Big cardboard cutouts in movie theater lobbies. Promotional cups at fast food restaurants. Kickass soundtracks featuring Seal. These things were once not part of our summer movie lexicon. And in the case of the tie-in song from Seal, they sadly haven't been for about twenty years.




Somewhere between the release of Jaws in 1975 and the mid-80s, the summer movie became it's own genre. Not specifically action, horror, sci-fi or comedy, it can't be placed into it's own single category, but much like the Supreme Court's views on pornography, you know it when you see it. There are certain movies like Jurassic Park, E.T., and even Guardians of the Galaxy, where they just make you feel like summer.




So, in anticipation of the launch of Cracked's new podcast, Cracked Movie Club, Alex Schmidt is welcoming on the show's two hosts, Tom Reimann and Abe Epperson for an ode to the summer movie. They trace the summer movie's origins in the seventies through to the state of the summer movie today, and then crown one film the best summer movie of all time.

              <itunes:summary>For many people, filmmaking begins and ends with the director. We call it a director's medium. It's their vision that guides the entire production and it's their name that gets the praise when a movie is good, and gets dragged through the mud when a movie stinks. While that's somewhat accurate, it's completely forgetting about the hundreds of artists, technicians, producers and craftsmen who bring equal skill to the table and without whom our favorite movies would be totally different.




Take Tim Burton, for example. His films have a "look," right? Edward Scissorhands, Pee-Wee's Great Adventure and Beetlejuice sort of exemplify Burton taking atomic age nostalgia and running it through the prism of Dr. Seuss on acid. Burton gets the credit for it, but all of those films (and a huge swath more) were art designed by the same guy, Rick Heinrichs. Without Heinrich's input, who knows what those movies would look like or if any of them would be as instantly memorable as they are now.




Alex Schimdt welcomes Michael Swaim and Matt Gourley (Superego, I Was There Too, James Bonding) to talk about people like Heinrichs. Unknown artists who have had as much of a guiding hand in modern cinema as your Spielbergs, Lucases and Scorseses, but who you've never heard of. 




And if you're in Los Angeles in July, make sure to come to our next live podcast taping. On Saturday July 8th at 7:00pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre, former zoo tour guide and current Cracked Podcast host Alex Schmidt will be joined by Cracked's Daniel O'Brien and Katie Goldin as well as comedians Caitlin Gill, Joey Clift and Matt Kirshen as they discuss snakes, hippos, octopuses and every other animal that could Planet-0f-the-Apes us if they tried. Tickets are only $7 and available here: https://goo.gl/rVhzPC




Also, make sure to subscribe to our new podcast, Cracked Movie Club! Why? Because almost every movie you love is secretly insane. Join co-hosts Tom Reimann and Abe Epperson (plus special guests) for a journey through the secrets, strangeness, and fan theories behind movies you’ll never see the same way again. And every month focuses on one director’s work, building a case for exactly why Hollywood’s greatest minds are weirder than you ever thought possible.

              <itunes:summary>Every morning when you wake up you (probably) do the same routine. In some order, you shower, use the toilet, shave and brush your teeth. In that respect, movie characters don't seem to exist in the same universe as us. Typically we only see them there if something important is happening, like if someone is taking a shower at the Bates Motel or if Danny Glover needs to use the toilet in 'Lethal Weapon 2'.




In part-three of our special mini-series 'Looking the Part', Soren Bowie and Daniel O'Brien break down the typical bathroom tropes we see all over pop-culture, from the different varieties of the scary shower sequence, to the strange way shaving is used to show a power imbalance. They're joined by screenwriter Seth W. Owen to break-down how a writer implements these types of scenes and to discuss the crazy reason so many movies have a part where the hero washes his face and then takes a long, steely look in the mirror.

              <itunes:summary>Believe it or not, the idea of the summer break wasn't invented until very recently. Before kids got the summer off, school basically was the break from months of grueling farm work or any of the other countless horrors we subjected children to before modern labor laws. As people moved out of farming jobs into the cities and modes of transportation out of the cities became cheaper and more efficient, the travel and recreation industry took flight. 




By the end of the twentieth century, resort towns, roadside attractions and theme parks were a main staple of the summer vacation and a huge source of money for local economies. Or at least the ones you've heard of were.




On this week's podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked writers and editors David Christopher Bell and Tom Reimann to discuss the origins of the summer break, how Disneyland was built, and a weird catalogue of failed theme parks lost to history.




And if you're in Los Angeles in July, make sure to come to our next live podcast taping. On Saturday July 8th at 7:00pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre, former zoo tour guide and current Cracked Podcast host Alex Schmidt will be joined by Cracked's Daniel O'Brien and Katie Goldin as well as comedians Caitlin Gill, Joey Clift and Matt Kirshen as they discuss snakes, hippos, octopuses and every other animal that could Planet-0f-the-Apes us if they tried. Tickets are only $7 and available here: https://goo.gl/rVhzPC




Also, be sure to get caught-up on our Cracked Podcast mini-series 'Looking the Part' co-hosted by Soren Bowie and Daniel O'Brien. Each Friday, Soren and Daniel are taking a deep-dive into the theories and hidden meanings behind movie hair, costumes and make-up. They examine the cryptic psychological reason behind Superman's dueling haircuts, why Ledger's Joker has scars and Leto's Joker has tattoos and a whole lot more.

              <itunes:summary>Admit it: the Harry Potter movies would be totally different if he didn't have a cool scar. If Harry looked like Gary Oldman in 'Hannibal', Hermione and Ron be afraid to talk to him and even the Dementors would think twice before getting close to him. But Harry's scar is pencil-thin, and hides behind his hair. He's got a good-guy scar. And characters like Heath Ledger's Joker, Freddy Krueger and Scar? Obviously bad guys, right? 'The Lion King' wasn't even trying when they named their bad guy.

Last week, in episode one of "Looking the Part," Soren Bowie and Daniel O'Brien analyzed what filmmakers were subtly telegraphing to audiences with characters' hair, mustaches and beards. This week the guys are joined by costume designer Jenna Wright to take a look at the skin, how scars and tattoos are used on good guys vs. bad guys, and the role costuming plays in developing a character.

              <itunes:summary>Understatement time: movies are hard to make. Every movie from The Godfather II to Joe Dirt 2​ is the result of years and years of tireless hard work from artists, craftsmen, teamsters, executives and advertisers-- all working in high pressure situations with tight deadlines, huge egos and insane amounts of money at play. Like GDP of a small island nation amount of money.

Odds are behind every movie, there's an absolutely insane story of inappropriate behavior, blatant disregard for safety regulations and famous people trying to murder each other. This week on the podcast, Alex Schmidt is joined by Cracked's Daniel O'Brien and Tom Reimann, comedian Jamie Loftus and writer Dave Schilling (The Guardian, Bleacher Report, Vice) to cover 17 movies with absolutely batsh*t behind the scenes stories, like basically every late-period Marlon Brando movie, the screwball comedy that shot an iconic scene on 9/11 and the backstage antics that led a very famous actor to punch James Cameron in the face.

              <itunes:summary>Every cheesy soap opera gives it away from the start-- the dashing Dr. Iago Montana is back from the dead...with a goatee. We as the audience know: IT'S NOT HIM, IT'S HIS EVIL TWIN! SEND HIM BACK FROM WHENCE HE CAME!

Again, it's easy to spot this from a mile away when you see it on a soap opera or a children's cartoon. The crazy thing is, whether you know it or not, every movie and TV show uses a special shorthand to convey if a character is good, evil, happy, sad, trustworthy or complicated. And more often than not, this shorthand is baked into how a character presents themselves. You just need to know what to look for. 

That's why in our new podcast mini-series sponsored by Dollar Shave Club, Cracked senior editor Soren Bowie and head of video Daniel O'Brien will dissect how characters' grooming habits, costumes and make-up are the biggest spoilers of all. This week on episode one, the guys will take a look at Superman's dueling hair styles, what different types of facial hair say and what it means when a character chooses to be bald.

This episode is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club. For a limited time, new members get their 1st month along with the Executive Razor and a tube of their Dr. Carver’s Shave Butter for ONLY $5 with FREE shipping.  That’s a $15 value for only $5 bucks!

              <itunes:summary>Checking the news right now, things are a little, how do you say...fucked. But there is some hope. As one of our guests puts it, "Rome wasn't burnt down in a day." Despite your Richard Spencers, your animated frog avatars and the whole extended cast of characters hell-bent on returning America to its pre-civil rights glory ("a hot dog cost a nickel and you could physically assault any person of color you saw! ") there are still people fighting for good in this country.

That's why this week we're chatting with comedians/podcasters/activists and all-around cool dudes W. Kamau Bell and Hari Kondabolu. Their podcast "Politically Reactive" is the modern guide to surviving in the age of Trump-- from how to be an active part of the resistance to just how to stay happy and not let the whole dumpster fire weigh you down on a day-to-day basis. First, Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien chat with W. Kamau Bell about his show "United Shades of America," what it was like interviewing Richard Spencer and a KKK leader and how he would go about fixing the violence in Chicago. Later, Alex Schmidt and Katie Goldin speak with Hari Kondabolu about #covfefe, how being a touring comedian gives you a different view of America and an absolutely crazy video of Malcom X on a Canadian Game show.

Also, make sure to stay tuned to the Cracked Podcast feed for a special three-part miniseries hosted by Soren Bowie starting this Friday, June 17th. Soren and Daniel O'Brien are dissecting movie make-up and costumes to show that how a character appears is the biggest spoiler of them all.

The world is full of systems and orders that we never really question because they've seemingly exited forever. And we're not talking about overthrowing the government or anything, we just mean basic things like how we take out our trash, when we vote and what movies we like to see when.

Think about it, why do all the big action-tentpole movies come out in the summer? Is it because kids are out of school? Beauty and the Beast has made a half-billion dollars domestically but it came out in March. If the next Spiderman came out in February, would nobody see it? Of course people would, so again, why all the big movies in the Summer?

This week on the podcast we're asking questions like these to some of the big staples of modern living. Jack O'Brien is joined by Adam Ganser and Alex Schmidt. They ask if there's a better way we can be voting, doing taxes and disposing of our trash, and make simple tweaks to improve professional sports, comic book movies and the 5-day work week.

And be sure to come see the next live taping of the Cracked Podcast on Saturday, June 10th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theater in Los Angeles.

              <itunes:summary>Even though drugs and alcohol have been a social lubricant since before we could write anything down, we like to think of history as this boring, stuffy museum exhibit where kings and queens drank iced tea, ate flavorless biscuits and had sex like our parents did (they've never had sex!). But hold onto your molly water, legal marijuana and fidget spinners, kids: history is as shitfaced wasted as any frat party or music festival, you just have to dig a little deep to find it. Also, it's hard for high school history teachers to talk about how great Ulysses S. Grant was and talk about how drunk he was the whole civil war. So they just don't mention that last part. American hero!

In this week's episode, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Carmen Angelica, Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim, as well as comedian Blake Wexler, for a deep dive into some of history's most secretly inebriated moments. They'll talk about wars that were almost started and wars that were ended thanks to booze, some surprisingly great accomplishments powered by LSD (please don't try them at home) and the American president who was so drunk all the time, it sort of puts the whole Trump presidency into horrifying perspective.

              <itunes:summary>Dana Gould is one of comedy's "that guys." His footprint is everywhere -- from writing on top-line hits like The Simpsons to cult-status titles The Ben Stiller Show -- and there's a chance you've never heard of him. If you're like Dana and you've spent the last quarter century hopping from great writers room to great writers room, while still managing to be a stand-up, a podcast host, and the voice of an animated gecko (not that one), you gain insights into life, entertainment and politics that a lot of us aren't privy to.

So on this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien, Daniel O'Brien and Michael Swaim sit down with Dana for an extended conversation about the world-building processes behind The Simpsons and Parks & Rec, Elvis Costello's worst night ever, and the cognitive dissonance of the average Trump supporter. We also ask him about Gex.

              <itunes:summary>The script is different but the wording is always roughly the same. Every few months some retiring journalist, former tech-mogul or aspiring Tomi Lahren-type goes viral because they've had it up to *here* with these gosh darn millennials. Between their clamoring for single-payer healthcare and their complaining about unpaid internships, it's like they hate America or something. Why can't they appreciate what they've got and be exactly what the generation before wants them to be?We've heard it a million times and, frankly, it's all bullshit. You know how we know? Because every generation has been lodging the same 4 complaints about their successors since the beginning of the written language (and probably before that too). Grug and all the other teens don't care about hunting mammoths like their fathers, they just sit around playing with those newfangled *wheels* all day. As long as we keep having kids, this will happen until the end of time.On this week's podcast, resident Gen-X'er-in-chief Jack O'Brien welcomes young upstarts Katie Goldin, Brett Rader and Josh Sargent onto the show to discuss why this never-ending argument is bullshit.

              <itunes:summary>The term 'movie magic' typically refers to the technical brilliance of bringing dinosaurs to life onscreen or how Denzel Washington can make an entire theatre of men and women pregnant with a single knowing glance. But there's a second type of movie magic that often goes overlooked: when movies are so good, we don't notice when their characters' plans' make absolutely no sense. All the great ones do this. In 'Return of the Jedi', all of the main characters get captured attempting to break Han Solo out of Jabba's palace, but it's all good because that was seemingly their plan all along? Why wait to get captured when you can just drop in, lightsabers blazing, bust your dude out of the carbonite and smoke fools in an epic prison breakout? Seems like Luke wanted to fight the Rancor all along.There's a whole category of these where bad guys try to weaponize monsters. From the 'Alien' series to 'Jurassic World', it's just a bad idea. Christopher Nolan is a real magician when it comes to bad movie plans. 'The Dark Knight', 'The Dark Knight Rises', and 'The Prestige' all have glaring examples of movie schemes that don't hold up under an ounce of scrutiny.So, join Jack O'Brien, Michael Swaim, and David Christopher Bell as they discuss the failing of Nolan's villains, why 'Westworld' makes no sense, and how the dudes in 'Jaws' had a bigger boat the whole damn time.And make sure to get tickets to our next LIVE Cracked Podcast, coming up on Saturday, May 13th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.

              <itunes:summary>Sometime around when Donald Trump started winning state primaries a year ago, the national mood went from, "Damn Daniel," to "oh fuck we're actually going to die in a rain of nuclear hellfire." That happens when a sitting US President attacks an almost-nuclear state on Twitter, as was the case a few weekends ago.With climate change, market instability, loss of privacy, the rise of fascism and a hair-triggered President all coming to a boil around the same time, it's understandable for images of apocalypse and dystopia to weigh heavily on the mind.So, this week the Cracked Podcast is doing an apocalypse grab-bag. Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Alex Schmidt and Saundra Sorenson to talk about bizarre apocalypse-level events that already happened and stories from places like Nigeria, Iraq, the Philippines and even Canada, where either natural disaster, terrorism or totalitarian government have turned everyday life into a dystopia.  Footnotes:Article/Video: Jalopnik: This is the Video CNN Will Play When The World Ends:  https://goo.gl/gvIO9Y Article: Cracked: 4 Nightmare Apocalypses Humanity Forgot Were Possible:  https://goo.gl/U48Y3v Article: Cracked: 6 Real Cities Destroyed By Incredibly Bizarre Apocalypses:  https://goo.gl/XHAvGG Article: Cracked: 6 Apocalypse Scenarios Society Says We're Overdue For:  https://goo.gl/SaBKaG Article: Cracked: 5 Horrifying Apocalyptic Scenarios  (That Have Already Happened):  https://goo.gl/5COk09 Article: The New Yorker: Doomsday Prep for the Super-Rich:  https://goo.gl/GBcpKk Article: The New Yorker: The Really Big One:  https://goo.gl/Y2QxOj  Article: Cracked: Evacuating A Modern City: 5 Realities in a Real Apocalypse:  https://goo.gl/24yA3h Book: Dave Eggers: Zeitoun:  https://goo.gl/WFXXF2 Article: The New Yorker: Hosed:  https://goo.gl/Rsg2aK Article: Smithsonian Magazine: Why Did Greenland's Vikings Vanish?:  https://goo.gl/vuP4C3</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Big news! This summer, Hollywood is delivering us our 6th Spiderman movie in the last 15 years. Fun! Time to re-hash all of our favorite story beats like dead uncles, having great responsibilities and kissing upside-down.So yeah, it seems like for the nth summer in a row, the great minds in the Hollywood dream factory are officially out of ideas. Our question is: why? When there are so many amazing stories from real life or incredible works that have yet to be adapted, why another Transformers?This is an issue only the After Hours crew (sans Michael) can figure out. On this week's episode, Jack O'Brien is joined by Soren Bowie, Daniel O'Brien and Katie Willert to fix reboots, throw out adaptations and pitch unbelievable real stories that would make for incredible movies, if only Hollywood had the balls to produce them.Footnotes:Article: Cracked 5 Really Awesome Movies Hidden Inside Really Crappy Movies:  https://goo.gl/gZliXV Article: LA Times: Zankou Chicken's Tragic Family Rift Impedes Chain's Growth:  https://goo.gl/xz1SXG  Podcast: Radiolab: Outside Westgate:  https://goo.gl/kp2hP9  (about Nairobi terror attacks in mall - soren talks about)Book: Jennet Conant: The Irregulars: Roald Dahl and the British Spy Ring in Wartime Washington:  https://goo.gl/3GJoqe Book: F.

              <itunes:summary>Nowadays, there's a huge emphasis on eating natural foods. Staying away from GMOs, pesticides, and processed sugars is generally thought of as a good thing. Some call it the paleo diet and it's a way to harken back to a simpler time, when our ancestors ate gathered fruits and hunted animals.Going paleo is very noble and all, but the problem is: the plants and animals we eat are nothing like they were thousands of years ago, let a hundred years ago. Before test tubes were ever a part of the equation, we selectively bred everything from cows and chickens to apples and bananas. You'd barf in your mouth just looking at an OG banana, let alone trying to eat it. And cows? They were bred from their ancestors, cattle-like animals called aurochs, who would fuck you up if you tried milking them.The food we eat today and think of as normal is just one example of a historical blindspot we have where we think commonplace objects and concepts have been around forever. But in this week's episode, Jack O'Brien is joined by Michael Swaim and Teresa Lee to discuss how things like food, love, racism and mourning dead children are all surprisingly recent developments.Footnotes:Article: Cracked: 7 Concepts We Totally Take For Granted, Like White People:  https://goo.gl/dVJVIL Article: Cracked: 6 Man-Made Things You Totally Thought Were Natural:  https://goo.gl/QvjHtN Article: Cracked: 5 Simple Things You Won't Believe Are Recent Inventions:  https://goo.gl/NzAfxQ Article: Seeker: Cows Almost Impossible to Domesticate, DNA Reveals:  https://goo.gl/w6Uai1 Article: Pacific Standard: How Lobster Got Fancy:  https://goo.gl/qa1LaL Article: Gawker: 'Breathtaking' Document Reveals Pepsi's Logo is Pinnacle of Entire Universe:  https://goo.gl/9tYW Article: Time: The Invention of Teenagers:  https://goo.gl/gWgJDs Article: The New York Times: Who's White?:  https://goo.gl/fAzpSE Podcast: Duke University Center for Documentary Studies: Seeing White:  https://goo.gl/6fWI65 Text: Ralph Waldo Emerson: English Traits:  https://goo.gl/LBPZFQ Article: The Atlantic: Thomas Jefferson: Radical and Racist:  https://goo.gl/F9McpQ Scholarly Article: Did The Ancients Care When Their Children Died?:  https://goo.gl/ozHK5a The Romantic Love Test:  https://goo.gl/ITk7yA This episode is brought to you by Louis C.K. 2017 on Netflix, Harry’s (www.harrys.com/cracked), and Adam and Eve (www.adamandeve.com code: CRACKED).</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>The 2016 Election made it clear that we live in an America divided.  There is a struggle between small-town and big-city America that comes down to more than just ideology. There's a general misunderstanding of how we live life that both sides fall victim to. To one side, the cramped and cavernous nature of city streets is straight-up anxiety-inducing. To the other, it's a surprise that dirt roads even exist at all. Didn't we get rid of those decades ago? But if the road is made of dirt, how will the driverless Uber know where to go? This is why Trump's President, ya'll!In one bubble, entertainment is taking in a show or a concert; in the other, entertainment is muddin' or taking random pills. One isn't better than the other. There are no judgements here. It's just that things that are absolutely commonplace in one world are so completely alien to the people in the other.On this week's podcast, city-boy Jack O'Brien is joined by columnist John Cheese, who still lives in small-town Illinois, and comedian Billy Wayne Davis who grew up in rural Tennessee but now travels the world and has seen the absurdity in how both sides live. Later, John Cheese and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) break-down their formative years in small-town Illinois and how the death of the local business turned their community into a living hell.Make sure to get tickets to our next live Cracked Podcast on Saturday, April 8th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Jack is joined by Daniel O'Brien, Soren Bowie and Katie Willert from 'After Hours' to talk about reboots we'd love to see, great movies hidden in bad movies and other movie ideas way too awesome to actually get made.

              <itunes:summary>We all know consciously to take advertising with a grain of salt. Those McDonald's burgers can't look as manicured in person the way they do in the ads. Examples like that are easy to catch. It's harder to spot false advertising when companies are bending the truth so much, your bullshit detectors don't know which way is up. Take Listerine mouthwash. It was originally sold as a surgical antiseptic until some ad men in the 1920s were like, "if we told everyone to wash their mouths out with this industrial cleaner every day, then we'd make so much money we could light our cigars with the cash, but how...". The answer was in a book of medical terminology. They looked up the fanciest word for bad breath -- halitosis -- and made an ad campaign telling everyone it was a chronic disease with only one cure."Hey, sonny boy! Does your dame ever tell ya you have bad breath?""Why, yes mister!""That's simply because you're dying son. Say here, drink this poison, BUT SPIT IT OUT FIRST. And do it every day for the rest of your life."And 90 years later we still use Listerine and still think halitosis is is a disease and not just latin for brush your damn teeth.Modern movies do this too. Sometimes if studios have a real clunker on their hands, they'll cut a trailer that's so unrepresentative of the movie, you would want to sue to get your money back. A lot of times this happens to children's movies with disastrous results for the parents that think they're about to spend 2 hours with a rapping kangaroo.So on this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked writers Carmen Angelica and JM McNab and producer Brett Rader for a discussion of horribly misleading movie trailers, straight-up advertising lies and the contemporary commercials that are messing with your perception of reality.Footnotes:Article: Cracked: Movies That Were Waaaaay Darker & Crazier Than Advertised:  https://goo.gl/w918NK Article: Cracked: The 6 Most Hilariously Misleading Movie Trailers:  https://goo.gl/9BLjqf Article: Cracked: 5 Things Movie Trailers Need to Stop Doing:  https://goo.gl/C8nfA5 Article: Cracked: 6 Dumbass Publicity Stunts That Fooled Everyone:  https://goo.gl/ypXnqc Article: Cracked: 6 Iconic Things You Won't Believe Began as Publicity Stunts:  https://goo.gl/0Rq4G Video: Helpful Honda Ad:  https://goo.gl/WfKsEn Video: Chevrolet "Real People" Ad:  https://goo.gl/PfPrvN Article: The News Wheel: Are Chevrolet's "Real People, Not Actors" Car Commercials Fake?:  https://goo.gl/aX2sua Video: If "Real People" Commercials Were Real Life:  https://goo.gl/n7agpC Video: Aaron Paul on The Price is Right:  https://goo.gl/LoUkIW Video: Josh Androsky on The Price is Right:  https://goo.gl/3abpcs Follow Jack O'Brien on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/jack_obrien Follow Carmen Angelica on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/c armesancheesesFollow JM Mcnab on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/jmmcnabagain Follow Brett Rader on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/brettrader</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>A brief glance at the cartoon version of America makes you think the South is pretty racist. Look at them, with their Confederate flags and voter ID laws! But while you were sleeping, the blue states were up to some pretty racist shit too. It's just that they've got better PR. For example, one of the biggest and most violent anti-segregation fights in US history didn't take place in 1950s Mississippi or Alabama, but 1970s Boston. The 70s! In Massachusetts! The land of Kennedys, Afflecks and liberal arts colleges was faced with the desegregation of schools and was like, "yo George Wallace, hold my beer!"To discuss some of the secretly f#&*ed up modern history of the United States, Jack O'Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by the guys from 'The Dollop': Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds. They discuss the Boston busing riots of the 70s, the comically-liberal blue state with secret ties to the KKK and why we're about to live through the Enron crisis all over again.Footnotes:The Dollop:  https://goo.gl/8O7wNl The Dollop's List of Sources:  https://goo.gl/gxXHza Podcast: The Dollop: Boston Busing 1974:  https://goo.gl/BUPukJ Podcast: The Dollop: Oregon and the Ku Klux Klan:  https://goo.gl/x4rrUf Podcast: The Dollop: Enron:  https://goo.gl/3bWy1J Image: 11 Nations of America Map:  https://goo.gl/vYXCPQ Article: US News & World Report: A Flag, A Busing Fight and a Famous Photograph:  https://goo.gl/bxvKSZ  Documentary: BBC: HyperNormalisation:  https://goo.gl/77XQpb  Article: Buzzfeed News: How Teens in the Balkans Are Duping Trump Supporters With Fake News:  https://goo.gl/kyOEKO Video: Oregon Whale Explosion:  https://goo.gl/gd5iPo The Cracked Podcast: Why Class in America Isn't Just About Income:  https://goo.gl/2tliZx Article: Siderea: Class (American):  https://goo.gl/tlmX4S This episode is brought to you by Squarespace (www.squarespace.com code: CRACKED), and Coca Cola & Powerade (www.coke.com/alwaysready.)</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>It's become your daily morning ritual. Wake up. Open Twitter. And here come's your fix. It's something like, "Trump Surrogate Says Jews in the Holocaust Didn't Have it So Bad!" and you're off to the races. How could he!? Do they know how insensitive that is!? And so on, and so forth until tomorrow, when it's something else. It's the rage machine and it exists on both sides. For every "Trump Eats Steak Well Done With Ketchup," you see on on the left, folks on the right will see something like "Communist Sympathizer Lena Dunham Thinks Pedophiles Should Teach Kindergarten." And the big secret is: both sides are getting played. The nonstop outrage engine is a contrivance, a counterfeit system made by people trying to profit off notoriety, and fueled by humanity's physiological addiction to anger. We hate it. And we love it. And we can't fucking stop.On this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), Katie Golden and Alex Schmidt to break-down how the non-stop rage machine works, who's profiting from it, and why this snake eating its tail is so addictive to the human psyche.Footnotes:Article: Cracked: 5 Ways to Stay Sane in an Era of Non-Stop Outrage:  https://goo.gl/yQ5qan Article: Cracked: 7 Creepy Ways Corporations Are Turning You Into an Addict:  https://goo.gl/nbQJhb Cracked Podcast: Why the Food Industry is Evil:  https://goo.gl/QsCyyC Article: The New Yorker: The Hell You Say:  https://goo.gl/1qOLI0 Article: Rand Corporation: The Russian Firehose of Falsehood Propaganda Model:  https://goo.gl/CmrBJe Check out  our new series   ' After the Trump '  on Cracked:  https://goo.gl/dDcGWZ</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>It's not something that you consciously notice, but movies speak to us in a secret language. They use a special shorthand to convey ideas or explain plot in the most efficient way possible. There's one problem though: they do it in the same couple dozen ways and recycle them over and over. And they need to stop. Or at least invent some new ones.Is someone's life crumbling away after a break-up? Just give them a beard and litter their apartment with Chinese food cartons. Want to show someone has a house or apartment, but no possessions? How about some well-placed Chinese food cartons? Is someone pulling an all-nighter with their work? More Chinese food cartons!If you're a person who even casually watches movies, you'll know so many of these the instant we bring them up and you'll never unsee them in any film going forward. To break down 25 of the biggest offenders, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Carmen Angelica, Soren Bowie and Daniel O'Brien. They talk about how people brush their teeth in movies, how men try to steal kisses and why you can never trust a fictional male nurse.Remember to buy tickets to our next live taping of The Cracked Podcast on this Saturday, March 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Jack and the gang are going to talk about Amity Island, Jurassic World and movies where vacations go awry in an attempt to figure out the best spring break you should take while vacationing in a fictional universe.Tickets are $7 and available here:  https://goo.gl/Li0ocH Footnotes:Podcast: Cracked: Dumb Movie Tropes That Need to Die Already:  https://goo.gl/oMk0jv Video: Cracked: 6 Bizarrely Specific Scenes  Hollywood Won't Quit Using:  https://goo.gl/i1Bll2 Video: Cracked: 4 Movie Straw Men Characters That Keep Showing Up:  https://goo.gl/17JVkG Video: Cracked: 7 Bizarrely Specific Ways Movies Get Normal Jobs Wrong:  https://goo.gl/lvqPpo Article: Cracked: 4 Bizarrely Specific Rules That Exist in Movie Universes:  https://goo.gl/Hs9iGT Article: Cracked: 3 Bizarrely Specific Job Trends in Movies:  https://goo.gl/a4NL9 Article: Cracked 4 Products That Only Exist in Movies:  https://goo.gl/q4RAF Cracked Photoplasties About Movie Tropes:  https://goo.gl/2BsDGG ,  https://goo.gl/x4QfQ ,  https://goo.gl/qnQZQr ,  https://goo.gl/gYZfr Article: The New Yorker: What Did Jesus Do?

              <itunes:summary>What separates the baby religions from the big ones? Is there anything specific that makes Catholicism or Islam more important than the shrine to The Noid that I have in my closet? Some religions make you go to mass or travel to Mecca, mine makes me eat pizza in the nude at least twice a week. The point we're trying to make is that what seems fringe or crazy now may have a billion devoted followers a thousand years from now. Mormonism was about as fringe as you could get a hundred years ago, less than a million followers, but now the there are around 16 million members and counting. Is there any religion that's out there now that's in the same place Mormonism was 100 years ago?To get a better understanding of some of these lesser-known religions and if they'll stand the test of time, Jack O'Brien's guest this week is Reza Aslan, who has a PhD in the study of religion and whose new show 'Believer' on CNN throws him head-first into the beliefs and practices of obscure religions. Among Scientology and Santa Muerte, they talk about the implausible origins of biblical literalism, the rare disorder that has tourists in Jerusalem thinking they're the messiah and a few big things that'll change your notions of Christianity and Islam.Remember to buy tickets to our next live taping of The Cracked Podcast on Saturday, March 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles.

              <itunes:summary>Who can forget the classic Oscars showdown between 'The Artist' and, uh, 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close'? Most of us can and did, in fact. Great job, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences! Way to keep your fingers on the pulse of American filmmaking by giving gold out to the 1930s-style silent film. Trailblazing. The Oscars have proven year after year that they're not the best barometer for judging the best or even the most popular films from a given year. Often they're really only judging movies on the criteria of being appealing to a group of old, white men with film industry jobs. Look at three of the last five best picture winners and their subject matter: 'Birdman'– an aging actor known for playing superheroes strives for artistic legitimacy; 'Argo'– Hollywood producers save hostages in Iran; 'The Artist'– Remember silent films? And let's pencil 'La La Land' into that list– an struggling actress and a struggling musician fall in love, become successful. Hollywood obviously has a problem being objective about movies wherein the subject matter is itself.So this week we're being objective for Hollywood. Jack O'Brien welcomes Cracked's David Bell, Adam Ganser and Brett Rader to discuss 2016's Best Picture nominees and award movies in some made-up categories that we'd like to see incorporated into the Oscar broadcast. Later they took a look back at the 2012 Oscars in which 'The Artist' won best picture and redistribute the awards with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.

              <itunes:summary>When you think about ancient human history, you probably think about sex, right? Who doesn't? And when you do, you probably imagine in your head (because you love envisioning your eldest relatives gettin' down) a very bland, puritanical form of sex where they do it through a sheet once every other year and only to conceive, right? Well, sorry to make you throw up in your mouth a little bit, but your ideas of chastened ancestors living repressed lives are as wrong as the next images we're about to put in your mind: ancient humans were nasty little horndogs. In fact, the basically standard modern ideas of monogamy and fidelity are extremely recent developments in human history. They've only been around for about 10,000 years -- a blink of the evolutionary eye.So what was the ancient hunter-gatherer love like actually like? And what can we learn about our own sex lives from looking at how the cavemen got down? A lot, actually. So we asked an expert. By studying prehistoric human cultures and the sex lives of our two closest genetic relatives, chimps and bonobos, Dr. Christopher Ryan has some pretty eye-opening stuff to share about human sexuality. So Jack O'Brien welcomes Dr. Ryan on this bonus episode of The Cracked Podcast to talk with Teresa Lee and Michael Swaim about swinging tribes-people, primitive vibrators and ape balls in a conversation that is bound to make you rethink everything you know about love and sexuality.Footnotes:Book: Christopher Ryan & Cacilda Jetha: Sex At Dawn:  https://goo.gl/NkZVye Podcast: Christopher Ryan: Tangentially Speaking:  https://goo.gl/uWl7mK Scholarly Article: Michael Gurven & Hilliard Kaplan: Longevity Among Hunter-Gatherers:  https://goo.gl/9LXdBo Article: Jared Diamond: The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race:  https://goo.gl/4k9zM Article: Cracked: 5 Gender Stereotypes That Used To Be The Exact Opposite:  https://goo.gl/zgnNG Article: Cracked: 6 Horrifying Facts That Get Left Out Of History:  https://goo.gl/ItWwcK Article: Cracked: 7 X-Rated Traditions That Prove History Was Horny As F*$&:  https://goo.gl/9XxknD Article: Cracked: The 6 Most Cynical Exploitations of Romantic Love in History:  https://goo.gl/Hik16 Article: Cracked: 6 Factors That Secretly Influence Who You Have Sex With:  https://goo.gl/oIAFD Article: Cracked: 5 Insignificant Things That Determine Who You Have Sex With:  https://goo.gl/0i8cQ</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Did you ever notice how every movie villain is just really ugly beyond belief? Emperor Palpatine? WRINKLED UP UGGO. Jafar? POINTY FACE. Scar? LITERALLY NAMED AFTER HIS FACIAL DEFORMITY.It's fucking dark when you think about how many movies this applies to; how the villain is usually someone trying to live a normal or equal life, but their ugliness just gets in the way. 'The Incredibles' is a perfect example. The villain is an ugly-little redhead kid who just wants for everybody to be a superhero, but the Incredibles are like NNNNNNOPE and throw him into a jet engine because only they should get to be superheroes.Yeah, of course Syndrome kills like 30 other superheroes and sets a giant death robot loose on a major metropolis, but just go with us for this thought experiment. His heart was in the right place. On this week's podcast Jack O'Brien welcomes Cracked's own Katie Goldin and Michael Swaim to unpack this trope and how you can see ugly bad guys ostensibly trying to do the right thing in franchises from Disney to The Lord of the Rings.Footnotes:Video: Cracked: 4 Disney Movie Villains Who Were Right All Along:  https://goo.gl/ddcdE7 Article: Cracked: 9 Famous Movie Villains Who Were Right All Along:  https://goo.gl/YHj25 Article: Cracked: 5 Movie Villains Who Were Right The Whole Time:  https://goo.gl/2P99EY Article: Cracked: 6 Reasons The Jedi Would Be The Villain In Any Sane Movie:  https://goo.gl/rPHaAO Article: Cracked: You Really Have No Idea Who The Villain Of Frozen Is:  https://goo.gl/SsbdFm Book: Chuck Klosterman: I Wear the Black Hat:  https://goo.gl/oxij5c Video: Kanye West: All Day (Live at the 2015 BRIT Awards):  https://goo.gl/xeDgWu This episode is brought to you by ZipRecruiter (www.ziprecruiter.com/cracked) and Harry’s (www.harrys.com/cracked).</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>If you've followed the news recently, you may have noticed the tiny little superpower Sarah Palin can see from her house has emerged from its slumber and re-injected itself into American politics. Not since the Cold War has Russophobia been as much of a part of our daily lives as it is now. Disinformation, strong man tactics and a corrupt and dictatorial turn have spilled into American life in a way that would've seemed like fiction only a few decades ago. What was once the well-trodden territory of black and white "duck and cover" videos and 80s action flicks is now a staple of Twitter feeds and nightly news broadcasts.So how did we get here, and what the hell does Russia even want from us this time around? That's what Cracked's Robert Evans and Michael Swaim are here to find out on this week's podcast. They join Jack O'Brien for an all-encompassing conversation about the KGB's history of deceit, Russia's methodology for spreading lies and Vlad Putin's psych evaluation. Later in the show, Jack interviews Cracked engineer Tatiana Nam about her experiences growing up in Russia.Our next live podcast is on Saturday, February 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Just in time for Valentine's Day, join Jack O'Brien, Michael Swaim and Teresa Lee as they welcome Dr. Christopher Ryan, author of Sex at Dawn for a discussion about love, relationships and why our sex lives now bear no resemblance to the way our ancestors got down.

              <itunes:summary>Once you hit your mid-twenties, everything starts beginning to suck. Your favorite band? Not as good as when they first came out. Favorite hangouts? All gone to shit since all the young people started showing up and ruining everything. The world? Basically a day away from total anarchy.Even the idea of time begins to suck. The present is somehow always the worst and no matter how bad your life was 5, 10 years ago– it all seems tinted with rose-colored glasses. Sure you were bored all the time, had no way of communicating with people who weren't your neighbors and loved Hootie and the Blowfish, but man the 90s were the absolute peak of human existence, right? Not really.Somehow humans have this bias that makes them think the world is always at the brink of complete collapse and that things were better before...before AIDS and Ebola started killing everybody; before all the bees disappeared; before crime took over the streets, when you could leave your front door open all day and the criminals would tip their hats and say, "good morning!"We're here to say this way of thinking is wrong and completely ignores all of the amazing advancements humanity is continuing to make every day. It's just you don't hear about them because the headline "Cancer Deaths Slowly and Steadily Dropping" isn't as flashy as "IT'S ALL BURNING DOWN MAN, DON'T EVEN BOTHER!"On the podcast this week, Jack O'Brien is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to talk about how we're neither going to hell nor are we in a hand basket. Poverty, war and disease are at all time lows, all you have to do is look away from the news to see it.Our next live podcast is on Saturday, February 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Just in time for Valentine's Day, join Jack O'Brien, Michael Swaim and Teresa Lee as they welcome Dr. Christopher Ryan, author of Sex at Dawn for a discussion about love, relationships and why our sex lives now bear no resemblance to the way our ancestors got down.

              <itunes:summary>Remember when you made fun of that kid in grade school for wetting the bed? You probably shouldn't have done that. I would apologize, change your name or leave the country. The reason is, psychologists suggest something called the Macdonald triangle, that there are three main characteristics of people who grow up to become killers: arson, cruelty to animals and bed-wetting. If you've got two or more, (in Jeff Foxworthy's voice) chances are you might be a serial killer.So, for another round of creepy solved and unsolved murders, we've invited back to the podcast America's foremost experts on the subject, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark from 'My Favorite Murder'. They join Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien to talk about Daniel's two hometown serial killers with a strange connection, two district attorneys who suffered mysterious ends, the unsolved murder of three girl scouts, and the murderer who buried his "kill kits" in the woods.Footnotes : My Favorite Murder:  https://goo.gl/gpaZN8 Article: Cracked: The 5 Most Terrifying Serial Killers You've Never Heard Of:  https://goo.gl/wh6B2U Murderpedia: Richard Biegenwald, "The Thrill Killer ":  https://goo.gl/2yq6l2 Murderpedia: Robert Zarinsky:  https://goo.gl/sM521t Documentary: Netflix: " Amanda Knox " :  https://goo.gl/y4LTOa Article: New York Times: For Letterman Stalker, Mental Illness Was Family Curse and Scarring Legacy:  https://goo.gl/tw4GQ6 Article: Washington Post: A Decade Later, Prosecutor Luna's Death Still a Mystery:  https://goo.gl/ydFmNI  Article: CNN: What Happened to Ray Gricar?:  https://goo.gl/Jd3Qqy Book: Gloyd McCoy: Tent Number Eight:  https://goo.gl/wKUgTZ  Murderpedia: Israel Keyes:  https://goo.gl/3t6NPG Documentary: HBO: There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane:  https://goo.gl/2rjXqJ Article: ABC News: Murder of Jasmine Fiore by Ryan Jenkins:  https://goo.gl/rc0YyT  Article: Today Costa Rica: Costa Rica Re-Opens Serial Killer Case):  https://goo.gl/iD2b0U</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>It's easy to think every piece of great art or unforgettable pop-culture is the result of effortless genius and precise intentionality. It separates the gods who create from us lay-people who like to eat cheese and can barely decide what to watch on Netflix. Take Spock's "Live Long and Prosper" hand signal. Yeah, it seems a little trivial, it's not 'Starry Night' or 'Hey Jude' or anything, but it's an icon that's lasted in the popular culture for 50 years and stands only second to "May the Force be with you" as the most recognizable totem of the sci-fi genre. Only a genius could've come up with that, right? Not really. Gene Roddenberry and company wanted the Vulcan salute to be the peace sign until Lenoard Nimoy took a stand for what was right and was like, "hey, this is dumb. I know this is coming from the dude wearing pointy ears right now, but can I just try this other thing so I don't look like the stupidest person on television?"And thank god Nimoy did that, because otherwise everyone would've thought 'Star Trek' was cheesy crap, or at least cheesier than it already was considered. So sometimes genius isn't in the intention as much as it is being able to realize a mistake, correct it and pray to god your new solution isn't as dull as the idea that preceded it. And pop culture is so littered with examples like these, there's a lone Native American man shedding a single tear over it. That much litter.So Jack O'Brien is joined on the podcast this week by Cracked's Teresa Lee and Alex Schmidt to talk about the behind the scenes mistakes and last-minute casting changes that made some movies and video games better. They also talk about some ghastly original versions of famous scripts that thankfully never saw the light of day. You don't want to know what the original description of Han Solo was (hint: it included the words "green" and "gills").

              <itunes:summary>Think of every RomCom trope and the one thing that separates it from being in a horror movie instead: the music. It's all the same mad libs game, and the outcome is always the same.Colin Firth/Hugh Grant/Matthew McConaughey runs to the airport/apartment building/twee bakery to declare his undying love for the maid/undercover journalist/baker he just met last week. The music swells, they kiss, the girl's less attractive best friend sighs, "oh I wish architect/surgeon/astronaut Chet Wellington could fall in love with me," and the credits roll. But what if, instead of the swelling music, it was a single piano note being played backwards, or an old-timey phonograph blowing out a single child singing, "Ring Around the Rosie?" 'Love Actually' would turn into an actual horror movie. The little boy chasing the little girl through the airport would take on a new interpretation. 'Shining 2: This Time It's British Christmas."RomComs are weird like that. They take a thing most people experience (falling in love) and turn it into a warped version of reality that only abides by backwards rules: where chasing someone down is considered romantic and getting the person to like you is the hardest part, not that whole spending the next 5 decades together thing. No, that part is easy (cries self to sleep).So this week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editor Soren Bowie and comedian and writer Jamie Loftus from 'The Bechdel Cast' to talk about how RomComs get almost everything wrong and when you change just one detail, they become creepy stalker thrillers.Our next live podcast is on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark from 'My Favorite Murder' are back for another hour of creepy unsolved murders and even creepier solved ones. Tickets are currently SOLD OUT but more will be released throughout the week  here:  https://goo.gl/5eew6F  . If the show remains sold out, we will have a standby list at the door, so make sure to come early!Footnotes:Jamie Loftus on Twitter:  https://goo.gl/5Jqr9m The Bechdel Cast on iTunes:  https://goo.gl/9FkEzU Video: Cracked: The Only Film Genre That Gets You To Root For The Bad Guy:  https://goo.gl/M3N8aW Video: Cracked: The 9 Creepiest Things Movies Portray As Romantic:  https://goo.gl/Vwt9hy Video: Cracked: Why Romantic Comedies Are Secretly Bad For You:  https://goo.gl/CeXsli Video: 'Love Actually' Cue Card Scene:  https://goo.gl/WVkGGy Video: 'Trainwreck' Dance Scene:  https://goo.gl/UtKVtQ Article: The Oxford Philosopher: The Birth of Tragedy:  https://goo.gl/wZbVmF This episode is brought to you by Casper Mattresses ( www.casper.com/cracked ) and Blue Apron ( www.blueapron.com/cracked ).</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Name the year: a new Star War is killing it at the box office, Russia and the US are having a staring contest and a madman driven by the power of celebrity is elected President. Yes, it's looking very much like we're living in the year 1980 right now and we want it to stop. I mean, if this is 1980, that means we're only three years away from more Ewoks. Although what is a Minion but yellow Ewok?But in all seriousness, the world has taken a turn for the conservative as it did in the early 80s. Free love and long hair were gone and replaced by shoulder pads, cocaine and rich white kids who thought the stock market was dope. So is there anything redeemable about this situation other than the prospect of getting some cool movies and punk music?Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien are joined by comedian, podcast host and 'Saved by the Bell' historian April Richardson for a conversation about how 80s pop-culture perfectly represented those regressive times and how some of the patterns we saw then are starting to appear now in our modern pop-culture. They also talk about 'Saved by the Bell' a lot. Like, a whole bunch.Our next live podcast is on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark from 'My Favorite Murder' are back for another hour of creepy unsolved murders and even creepier solved ones.

              <itunes:summary>It's not just us right? There are too many damn movies and TV shows to keep up with. When we're not in the middle of a season of Game of Thrones, Westworld, Silicon Valley, Stranger Things, or House of Cards, there are always 40 other shows just waiting to get started. If only you were ready to make the commitment. Your girlfriend wants you to propose but you can't even commit to Six Feet Under, let alone the next 60 years of your life.This glut of TV shows we're experiencing completely fails to lack the steady stream of quality movies coming out not only in the US but all around the world. And the surplus of movies doesn't even address how behind you are on music. Open up Spotify or look at the next festival lineup and you can barely recognize a third of the bands there. And we're not being old fogies complaining about music these days-- most of these bands are good-- we just can't keep up with them. 21 Pilots, 21 Savage, 21 Scarecrows. Only one of those band names is completely made up.So to give a little order to this exponentially insane world, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to talk about some of their favorite they discovered in 2016. They commiserate about the superabundance of content and Soren gives some completely unsolicited home improvement advice.Our next live podcast is on Saturday, January 14th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles. Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark from 'My Favorite Murder' are back for another hour of creepy unsolved murders and even creepier solved ones.

              <itunes:summary>2016 is almost over. Yes the endless, rotten sh*t hurricane of a year that took awayBowie, Prince and Florence Henderson and gave us Trump, Harambe and the Zika virus is finally drawing to a close. So, to give this b*tch a proper viking funeral, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Cody Johnston, Daniel O'Brien and Alex Schmidt and comedian Caitlin Gill to review our culture's year-in-review process. They'll also shine a much needed light on some of the more overlooked stories from the year. For example, two-headed sharks keep appearing in our oceans and no one knows why. Even all the world's Bond villains are like, "don't look at us, we thought that was you." And Kim Kardashian! It feels like she's been on every magazine cover for the last 35 years and this year she got kidnapped at gunpoint and it barely raised an eyebrow. What is going on!?To wrap up the conversation, Jack and company share some of their favorite cultural things from the year and report from the future with a preview of our 2017 year in review.Footnotes:Article: Yahoo's Top Search Terms in 2016:  https://goo.gl/iD9lvm Video: Kanye Cancels Show And Slowly Floats Away:  https://goo.gl/P0rOQq Article: The Guardian: Google, Democracy and the Truth About Internet Search:  https://goo.gl/GtOx4J Video: Senator James Inhofe Brings a Snowball to Senate:  https://goo.gl/f3gSeP Article: The Telegraph: Russian Scientists Besieged By Pack of Polar Bears:  https://goo.gl/SWGXaY Article: National Geographic: Two-Headed Sharks Keep Popping Up and No One Knows Why:  https://goo.gl/DF725J Article: Slate: Texas GOP Rep Louie Gohmert Will Save Us From Gay Space Colonies:  https://goo.gl/vax51L Instagram: @major_hoolihan:  https://goo.gl/OMdJQh Video: Samantha Bee: Eddie Eagle:  https://goo.gl/LfLgtI Video: Samantha Bee: Trump Can't Read:  https://goo.gl/pl1Hi9 This episode is brought to you by LifeAfter podcast, Harry’s ( www.harrys.com  code: CRACKED), I.T. is Greater Than Sci-Fi podcast, and Loot Crate ( www.lootcrate.com  code: GIFTING15).</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>You know how when you watch and old movie and there's a Y2K joke or a WAZZZZUUUP and you think, "man, this hasn't aged well." There's now a whole category of those movies that are just classically heroic dudes being absolute dicks to women. There's even a whole supercut ( https://goo.gl/ejmmDH)   of all the times James Bond hits women. Just Sean Connery slapping women left and right like he's Moe and every Bond girl is Larry and Curly.Now, hear us out on this, but there's a chance that images like this might have been hurting women instead of helping them. Crazy. Maybe normalizing violence against women or showing Harrison Ford literally whipping ( https://goo.gl/QRB2Gw)   Kate Capshaw into kissing him have given men unrealistic ideas about how things like consent work.This week Jack O'Brien brings on Carmen Angelica, Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Katy Stoll to talk about the modern-day minefield of consent, what movies have been getting wrong about it, why it's so easy for guys to get defensive about it and a female perspective on why it's so damn important.Footnotes:Carmen Angelica Twitter:  https://goo.gl/ATcFbz Katy Stoll Twitter:  https://goo.gl/FzYPCG Jason Pargin Twitter:  https://goo.gl/pNcIwx  Article: Cracked: 7 Reasons So Many Guys Don't Understand Sexual Consent:  https://goo.gl/cNurtf Video: Cracked: How To Know If A Girl is DTF:  https://goo.gl/bkx5dS Video: Han and Leia's First Kiss:  https://goo.gl/HbzMm0 Article: Cracked: 5 Things Women Want Most:  https://goo.gl/WsEPiR Article: Cracked: Everything A Woman Should Know Before She's Groped:  https://goo.gl/pcyEbj Article: Cracked: 5 Ways Modern Men Are Trained To Hate Women:  https://goo.gl/UJtzh Article: New York Times: Nurse in V-J Day Photo Dies:  https://goo.gl/KFxJci Article: Vice: I Want a Feminism Class for Boys:  https://goo.gl/7YUFf1 This episode is brought to you by I.T. is Greater Than Sci-Fir ( www.VMware.com/radius/scifi ), Foot Cardigan ( www.footcardigan.com  code: HOLIDAY16), The Bouqs ( www.bouqs.com  code: CRACKED), and Indochino ( www.indochino.com  code: CRACKED).</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>In the past few weeks, we've written about not panicking, why you should absolutely panic, and just about everything in between when it comes to the Trump presidency. One thing we haven't quite touched on yet is how real life actual people will be affected by the changes he promised to make during his campaign. One thing Trump already promised to do is repeal an Obama executive order called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.  DACA allows children who were brought here illegally (keyword: children) to gain somewhat-legal status; protection from deportation, a social security card, in exchange for staying out of trouble and being an active part of the workforce. These are law-abiding, tax-paying young adults whose home country for all intents and purposes is America. A lot of them don't even know the know the language spoken in their country of origin. The shittiest thing is these people might be the first to be deported because they had the unmitigated gall to actively try to live in the United States legally.Robert Evans and Tom Reimann grab the reigns of the podcast this week and have conversations with a potential victim of the removal of DACA, a transgender woman whose medications may no longer be covered, and an army vet whose parents are immigrants to talk about the scary world they've been suddenly thrust into. Later a British journalist joins to talk about the parallels to Brexit and why we might soon see fascist vs. anti-fascist fighting in the streets, and how it could look.If your life has been concretely or irrevocably changed by the new administration, we want to hear your story.

              <itunes:summary>It's pretty safe to say that after years of Sherlock Holmes adaptations and countless CBS crime procedurals (he was the supreme leader of a cult, but now he's leading the Supreme Court!) most people with a pretty steady diet of TV and movies think they're pretty good armchair psychologists.If you learn of a prison riot on the news, you'll cite the Stanford prison experiment and claim that we're all just a baton and a uniform away from turning into monsters. If the news later reports of a man who stabbed his mother, you'll find a Freudian explanation for the crime that speaks of Oedipal repressed sexuality and the phallic nature of stabbings. Bad news: turns out everything you learned about psychology from the shiny little box in the center of your living room isn't totally accurate. Not only do movies and TV shows take giant liberties with how psychology works, the psych field itself has a hard time getting out of its own way: studies can be biased for multiple reasons, the replication crisis impedes the verification of discoveries and news outlets only report on the grabbiest psych headlines and and skew the truth.So on this week's podcast, we're putting a bunch of psych myths in a straight jacket, tossing them in a padded room and throwing away the key. Cracked's Jack O'Brien, Daniel O'Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Peter McGraw, an expert in behavioral science and a marketing and psychology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. They dispel pop-psych stories like the Milgram experiment, power posing and the Mozart effect.Also make sure to buy tickets to our next LIVE podcast taping on Saturday, December 10th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, California.

              <itunes:summary>Believe it or not, Matthew McConaughey's thesis (from behind a bookshelf inside a black hole) that love is the most powerful force in the universe isn't the most scientifically accurate thing Hollywood has offered us lately. It should come as no surprise that movies take a lot of liberties with astrophysics and what is possible or impossible in the realm of outer space. Like, sending up a crew of men less qualified than Donald Trump (too soon?) to blow up an asteroid? That's probably not in NASA's Plans A through "we ran out of letters" of how to stop a meteor on a collision course with Earth. Even in more fantastical movies like the Star Wars or Star Trek films, you just get very inadequate image in your head of how space works. Take asteroid belts, for example. It's a belt! Made of asteroids! Asteroids as far as the eye can see! You can't safely pilot your ship through them because there are just so many damn asteroids! I've had it with these motherf**king asteroids on this motherf**king belt! We're sorry to say that's now how the asteroid belt works at all. The average distance between bodies in the asteroid belt is 600,000 miles, which is more than double the distance between the Earth and the Moon. So traveling through the asteroid belt is less dodging asteroids like Han Solo and more, "we passed through the asteroid belt?" To dispel some more myths about how space works, Jack O'Brien and Alex Schmidt are joined by Dr. Farah Alibay, a real life scientist at JPL who gets to play with styrofoam models of planets all day and is currently working on a mission that's trying to scoop a 2o-ton boulder off an asteroid, which is as cool as it sounds. Footnotes: Farah Alibay Bio :  https://goo.gl/iM4NI7  Podcast: How NASA Was Born Out of Magic Loving, Orgy Having Nerds :  https://goo.gl/sbSjcR   Video: To Scale - The Solar System :  https://goo.gl/yxUggj GIF: Jupiter's Surface in Motion :  https://goo.gl/BEUaJz  Video: Pigeons in Space :  https://goo.gl/H3Anrr  Video: Spiders in Space :  https://goo.gl/VrQQkJ   Video: Russian Meteor Reaction :  https://goo.gl/R6WKTA  Image Gallery: Cupola Module on the ISS :  https://goo.gl/IJUO5U  Article: The Drake Equation :  https://goo.gl/rYZVzF  Article: Myths Everyone Believes About Space (Thanks To Movies) :  https://goo.gl/H0WiLF  Article: Things About Space You're Picturing Almost Exactly Wrong :  https://goo.gl/qDDpgn  Article: Reasons Space Travel Will Always Suck :  https://goo.gl/VfNZ  Article: Reasons Life in Space Sucks (That Sci-Fi Doesn't Show You) :  https://goo.gl/jNuONd  Article: The Most Mind-Blowing Things Ever Discovered in Space :  https://goo.gl/XztW9  Article: Real Planets Way Weirder Than Anything in Science Fiction :  https://goo.gl/Rb6Yy6  Article: Mind-Blowing Things Found in Our Own Solar System :  https://goo.gl/Azquk  This episode is brought to you by Squarespace and MVMT Watches.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Scenario: you've got a time machine and you only like two things in this life: eatin' breakfast and killin' Nazis, and you've already eaten breakfast. Your obvious next step is to travel to April 20th,1889 and throw baby hitler down a well and then blow up the well,  right? Or is there something better you could do with your time?The whole 'would you kill baby Hitler' thought experiment has been a surprisingly prevalent pop-culture moral question at dinner parties and bad games of Cards Against Humanity. Even Jeb Bush weighed in with his thoughts back in a simpler time when he thought he could be president. His answer, by the way, was, "hell yeah!" ( https://goo.gl/IzBaxA ).This got us thinking, what would be some other moments in history to travel back to and change one thing? One answer might be incredibly simple: November 8th, 2016. Who wouldn't go back in time to stop the events of last Tuesday? Only time will tell if that day becomes one of the giant crossroads in the slow forward march of history.So today Jack O'Brien and Alex Schmidt are posing that question to our five comedian guests: Steven Wilbur, Riley Silverman, Caitlin Gill, Blake Wexler and Eric Lampaert. When would you go in history to change one thing, what would it be and why?Footnotes:Alex Schmidt on Twitter:  https://goo.gl/oF6OFj Steven Wilbur on Twitter:  https://goo.gl/CSBfaF Riley Silverman on Twitter:  https://goo.gl/ipJ8TX Caitlin Gill on Twitter:  https://goo.gl/HblhwS Blake Wexler on Twitter:  https://goo.gl/hBY7tL Eric Lampaert on Twitter:  https://goo.gl/b70FTt Biography.com: About Assassination of Franz Ferdinand:  https://goo.gl/1rRB5D Smithsonian: How One Man Accidentally Killed The Oldest Tree Ever:  https://goo.gl/vuVg8r " William Tecumseh Sherman: In The Service Of My Country":  https://goo.gl/OobZ9h Radiolab: Be Careful What You Plan For:  https://goo.gl/UwvO4w This episode is brought to you by Indochino, Loot Crate, and Wondery.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States of America. It's going to be okay. Sit down, have a cookie, breathe into this bag and put on your mandatory 'Make America Great Again' baseball cap. We'll survive this, right?Despite the sun coming up in the morning and life seemingly going on like normal, the world might've been forever changed last night. So we needed to break the little glass box, pull the lever and record an emergency podcast. Jack O'Brien is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to make sense of what happened at the polls last night, why we should've seen it coming from a mile away and what we can actively do to prevent this from happening again. As Jason says on the site today, "Do the opposite of Panic. Work through the problem." It'll all be okay.And if we're still alive this weekend , make sure to catch the next LIVE taping of The Cracked Podcast, this Saturday, November 12th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, CA. Jack O'Brien, Daniel O'Brien and Michael Swaim will be joined by an expert in psychology to talk about some of the psychological myths everyone seems to believe: like Rorschach tests (sorry, they don't work), middle child syndrome (not real); and depression (totally real, but antidepressants might not actually work very well).

              <itunes:summary>"Our way of life here is about nine meals away from anarchy." That's a quote from retired Marine Colonel David Couvillon, who governed the Wasit province of Iraq during the US occupation and clearly a man who has never seen the Cracked office when our daily lunch of filet mignon and caviar is fifteen minutes late. His experiences in Iraq mean he knows a thing or two about modern political unrest and civil war, which makes that quote even more terrifying.As you might've heard, there's an election tomorrow (if you're reading this day it's coming out), and no matter what the outcome, a portion of the country is going to feel like they've had it stolen from them. Matt Bevins, the Governor of Kentucky, has already promised that, "blood will be shed" if Hillary wins and there's no doubt real people are taking promises like these to heart.So how likely is it that America falls into a second civil war? What would that look like? That's what we're asking Cracked's Robert Evans and Teresa Lee on this episode of The Cracked Podcast. They'll explain to us that violent unrest on American soil is a lot more possible than you think and that it wouldn't be North vs. South or Red vs. Blue, but a war fought on thousands of different sides.Also, make sure to catch the next LIVE taping of The Cracked Podcast, this Saturday, November 12th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, CA.

              <itunes:summary>You're probably familiar with Kurt Vonnegut's required reading, or rather the Kurt Vonnegut books your high school English teacher required you to read. 'Slaughterhouse-Five,' 'Cat's Cradle,' and maybe 'Breakfast of Champions' were rays of satirical sunlight in your curriculum between long stretches of Jane Austen and Herman Melville (both great authors, but booooooring). But what about his other 12 novels and the dozens of short stories and other works you're not familiar with?The Cracked Podcast is going to mix it up this week with an introduction to our new Vonnegut book club, a brand new podcast with Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim, the Kurt Vonneguys. Once a month, Alex and Michael will work through the Vonnegut library, dissecting the recurring themes and characters, highlighting some amazing Kurt-isms and providing a general overview of Kurt's work as the connective tissue to modern sci-fi.In this week's episode, Alex and Michael cover Vonnegut's overlooked first novel, 'Player Piano,' a satirical '1984'-esque warning about the horrors of automation. When you're through, you can check out episode two of Kurt Vonneguys here ( https://goo.gl/dtD9Qz ), where they look at Vonnegut's masterwork, 'The Sirens of Titan.'

              <itunes:summary>You thought it would disappear before the Iowa primary. You thought it would surely never happen when its tax returns were released. You definitely thought it was going away as it drove past you on an 'Access Hollywood' tour bus. But it's finally here. We're doing a Trump podcast! Please hide your women and children.We've actually kind of skirted around Trump a lot in the last year. We talked about the class divide in America, how it's not necessarily driven by money and how the Donald personifies the hopes and desires of the "lower class". We even talked about narcissism as America's mental disorder, symbolized again by king narcissist himself, Donald J. Trump.So this week, Crooked Jack O'Brien is joined by Lyin' Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) in hopefully our final Trumpcast. They take one last look at Mr. Tinyfingers by looking at the 40% or so of people who are voting for him in a couple weeks no matter what. It's easy to pass them off as toothless rednecks, racist uncles and cartoonish extras from Daily Show segments, but they are real people who didn't come to support Trump out of nowhere. This cultural shift has been hiding in plain sight and the only problem was the left hadn't even bothered to look. By really dissecting the reasons for this social chasm, we'll prove that even the craziest of Trump supporters should actually be listened to, no matter how orange and absurd their political mouthpiece is.Footnotes:Cracked: How Half of America Lost Its F**king Mind:  https://goo.gl/KBJs5W Cracked Podcast: The 11 Nations of America:  https://goo.gl/dTJnm4 Cracked Podcast: Why Class in America Isn't Just About Income:  https://goo.gl/4juPht 2012 County-by-County Election Map:  https://goo.gl/EKH1xb Map of County-by-County Economic Growth:  https://goo.gl/u3vqyo This episode is brought to you by Harry’s and Adam and Eve.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Did you ever have the sneaking suspicion that when your history teacher rolled out the old A/V cart for movie time that he was completely hungover? Or that that one teacher who seemed to hate you on a molecular level was giving you bad grades on purpose? Chances are you were right and we have the evidence to prove it: full admissions of guilt from actual teachers. Suck it, Mr. McKinley!Yes, we got real (and anonymous) teachers to come on the podcast and dish the dirt about the real behind-the-scenes of this supposedly squeaky-clean profession. Spoiler alert: teachers are all hot messes.Interviewing our panel of masked and maybe inebriated educators, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Soren Bowie and Daniel O'Brien as well as Andrew Orvedahl and Maria Thayer from truTV's hilarious show 'Those Who Can't'. They share some all-too-common stories about teachers sleeping with their students, some tips for spotting the teacher who's secretly living at the school and why the teachers who instruct the youngest grades are the most likely to be drunk.

              <itunes:summary>Last Halloween ( https://goo.gl/Eu1CJU ) we spooked you with  a melange of real-life horror stories that had little explanation. There was the dead girl who was found in a water tower above the hotel where she went missing. Security tapes were inconclusive, except for one minor detail: it appeared as if she was hiding and running away from...absolutely nothing. Was it a ghost? An inter-dimensional monster? A coked-up Harry Potter in his invisibility cloak? We have no idea. Scary.There was also the story of Major Henry Rathbone, the unfortunate fellow who took the invitation of Abraham Lincoln to see a play at Ford's Theater. Rathbone was so wracked by guilt over Lincoln's death that he straight-up turned into Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and slaughtered his whole family. Horrifying.So in anticipation of All Hallow's Eve, Jack O'Brien is joined by first time co-host Nick Mundy as well as Cracked's Carmen Angelica and Josh Sargent and comedians Eric Lampaert, Ryan Singer and Anna Seregina to share more macabre and strange stories that actually happened. They'll discuss the thousands of missing people in our national parks and why the government may be covering it up, the French impostor who killed his entire family, the scary clowns that are tormenting America right now, the French Jack the Ripper and the famous serial killer H.H.

              <itunes:summary>How many times a week do you see someone posting a headline to Facebook with a ridiculous scientific claim about your health? '9 out of 10 Doctors Say You Should Stop Exercising,' 'New Report Shows Milk Prevents Cancer,' 'New Study Shows Milk Is Pure Poison, Stop Drinking Milk Or Else Everyone You Know Will Die!' If you're like us, you probably don't even pay attention to them anymore because the results are so fluid and often contradictory. Tell us now– are eggs good for you? You have no idea. Yes, but not the yolks? Who the hell knows anymore?There's a reason why so many studies about human health and behavior are so unpredictable, and you may not be happy with the answer. It's because studying humans is freaking impossible, and that's never going to change. When you're studying people, there's an endless amount of incalculable variables that make reaching a conclusion a futile undertaking. And even if you control for as many factors as you can think of, you still might not be able to account for your subjects' genetics or the very likely chance that they're just lying to you. "Oh, my diet? Yeah, I eat 2 salads a day, no dressing, and a plain cut of grilled chicken for dinner. I definitely didn't drive through McDonalds on the way here and order a #3 with a Dr. Pepper, no pickles."In conclusion, don't trust anything you read or hear ever, or do, because science doesn't really know what it's doing. On this week's episode Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined by executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to talk about how and why science fails us in this regard and why you should probably still be flossing.Also, you can see us on Saturday, October 29th at the Now Hear This podcast festival in Anaheim, California.

              <itunes:summary>Psychedelics, maaaaan! Gateway to the inside of your miiiiiiiind! Enemy of the maaaaan, maaaaan! Also, a thing that's been around for so long in human history, we don't even have an accurate date for when our ancestors started doing them. They've just been, for all we know, a common way to explore, escape and seek spiritual oneness for hundreds of thousands of years.Some great stuff has been conceived of while on psychedelics: while on LSD, Francis Crick conceived of the double-helix shape of DNA, Steve Jobs cites LSD as one of the major influences of his life's work, and some biblical scholars think the Bible may have been written with the aid of some magic mushrooms. So why does the government hate the stuff? Especially as more research is coming out that says that psilocybin (the active ingredient in mushrooms) does wonders for the terminally ill and MDMA may be the key to curing PTSD.On this week's podcast Jack O'Brien enlists the help of comic Shane Mauss and Cracked editor Robert Evans to find out. First Jack and Shane examine some of the medicinal effects of psychedelics, from mushrooms to DMT to MDMA, and talk about how America's war on drugs is prohibiting important research into these areas. Later, Robert Evans calls in to discuss how some ancient cultures got high and how an individual's reaction to drugs may not be chemical, but cultural.Also, make sure to come see our THREE live shows this October!First, at 9pm on Thursday, October 6th at the UCB Sunset Inner Sanctum, Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien take a behind-the-scenes look at America's most under-appreciated profession: teachers.

              <itunes:summary>We all know Rome wasn't built in a day. But in the fake Hollywood adaptation, "Rome Wasn't Built in a Day," it's probably built over the course of a short montage set to peppy music, where it feels like it's built in 20 minutes.That's one of the subtle lies movies and TV imprint on our minds- that monumental things can be achieved in relatively short periods of time or with relatively little effort. Doc Brown hits his head and comes up with the idea for a time machine, and the hardest part is sourcing plutonium from a crew of gullible Libyan terrorists. This myth of invention affects how we look at history too. In our minds, Thomas Edison is a guy who just pulled the idea for the light bulb out of thin air (or from about 3 inches above his head, right after he thought of it), but he's just the guy who happened to invent the best one.These recurring myths are what we're talking about today. Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Alex Schmidt to talk about this invention myth, why we mistakenly think the President controls the economy, how we assume that there are real-life criminals like movie criminals and why a bomb with a timer on it is the stupidest idea in the world.Also, make sure to come see our THREE live shows this October!First, at 9pm on Thursday, October 6th at the UCB Sunset Inner Sanctum, Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien take a behind-the-scenes look at America's most underappreciated profession: teachers.

              <itunes:summary>Ahh September, the leaves are changing into autumnal shades of yellow, red and orange, the air has a chilly bite, and movie theaters are being inundated with 'Based on a True Story' Oscar-bait. This month alone we've got 3 true story movies that shouldn't have much suspense to them: 'Sully' (the plane lands); 'Deepwater Horizon' (oil gets everywhere); and 'Snowden' (dude's in Russia).We've got a little hint for you, Hollywood: how about releasing a movie that isn't about something that happened, like, six seconds ago? History is full of amazing true stories and you're giving us a movie about the most unceremonious, bloodless and explosion-less crash in the history of aviation? Pshhh.This week we've got seven true stories for you that we promise would make better movies than 'Snowden': from the mad warring paleontologists who would rather burn down a museum than see each other gain a modicum of success, to the 10th century Slavic saint who murdered just everybody. Jack O'Brien and Michael Swaim co-host live from the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles with Cracked guests Carmen Angelica, Tom Reimann and Alex Schmidt, and guest comedians Lindsay Adams, Sunah Bilsted, Eli Olsberg and Steven Wilber.Jack is also joined by Cracked writer and researcher Evan Caris to talk about a major world event that is always underserved in film: World War I.Footnotes:Salon Interview with Atilla Ambrus, The Whiskey Robber: http://goo.gl/FLsxwZBallad of the Whiskey Robber: https://goo.gl/vxlFswCracked: 6 People With WTF Secret Lives Absolutely Nobody Saw Coming: https://goo.gl/XBXQ7cBiography of Julie d'Aubigny: http://goo.gl/c6fyrw'60 Minutes' Clip with Jack Barsky: https://goo.gl/mZxy4LBiography of 'The Bone Wars': https://goo.gl/8mpfQUBiography of Olga of Kiev: https://goo.gl/XxM08MBiography of Sarah Jacob, The Fasting Girl: https://goo.gl/wlG4rqTom Reimann on Twitter: https://goo.gl/wgHhK2Carmen Angelica on Twitter: https://goo.gl/B7W9JRSteven Wilber on Twitter: https://goo.gl/4UNvFfLindsay Adams on Twitter: https://goo.gl/1L02UEAlex Schmidt on Twitter: https://goo.gl/y5P6YoEli Olsberg on Twitter: https://goo.gl/3eVRelSunah Bilsted on Twitter: https://goo.gl/3VgjE6This episode is sponsored by Casper Mattresses and Blue Apron.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>It's underestimated how important your sense of hearing is, how much it affects your daily life in ways you don't fully appreciate. Take the inconceivable geometry you do in your head all the time, thanks to your ears. Say you're standing with your back facing a street and you hear a car approaching from the right--how do you know that? Your brain is instantly calculating the miniscule differences in volume and the slight difference in time it takes for the sound of the car to reach both ears. Yes, thank you Captain Obvious, but it's still an amazing feat that you're performing all the time, every day, with everything you hear.You probably don't even know how much you hear every day, how unaccustomed to silence you actually are. Silence actually sounds weird, your brain knows something is wrong when it's absolutely quiet. Conversely, really loud places like cities take up so much of your subconscious mental capacities that they also create a sense of unnerving. That's why the sound of nature is so relaxing to us.On this week's podcast Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined by actor/comedian Johnny Pemberton, whose podcast 'Twisting the Wind' is an incredible aural experiment, a constantly surprising manipulation of sound that pushes the boundaries of what's expected in a podcast. They talk about the power of noise pollution, incredible Tuvan throat singing rap music, how John Williams stole everything from Russian composers and sonic devices that mess with our heads like speech jammers and The Mosquito.Footnotes:Johnny Pemberton's Website:  http://goo.gl/bZ9Tv9 Twisting the Wind with Johnny Pemberton:  http://goo.gl/SzgA4H TED Talk on Noise Pollution:  https://goo.gl/YFtlrX Tuvan Throat Singing:  https://goo.gl/o7yX7h Tuvan Throat Singing Rap:  https://goo.gl/fV8RuQ The Best of Shostakovich:  https://goo.gl/kZp2aA Timmy Thomas - Why Can't We Live Together:  https://goo.gl/QlPFzP Pantera - Mouth for War:  https://goo.gl/MBE8pQ Trailer for Glenn Gould Documentary "Genius Within":  https://goo.gl/5OoTlN The Daily Beast: Slow TV:  http://goo.gl/0p8o6x In-Browser Speech Jammer:  https://goo.gl/Te4jr2 Reading Dr. Seuss with Speech Jammer:  https://goo.gl/TmFR68 Infrasound:  https://goo.gl/ZWe5ao The Mosquito:  https://goo.gl/YnYV8h Come see us at the Now Hear This podcast festival:  nowhearthisfest.com This episode is sponsored by Squarespace and Wealthfront Veritone.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>We've never known more about our world and our universe, but at the same time it feels like there are more people who completely ignore science than ever before. They can come in all shapes and forms of crazy. There are anti-vaxxers, climate change truthers, and for some reason we've still got flat-earthers. Flat-earthers! C'mon people what year is it?! Didn't Magellan put that one to rest, like, 500 years ago?Surely this all comes down to religion, right?Not exactly. A Gallup poll found that about 40% of Americans believe Earth was created by God less than 10,000 years ago. However, of that group, 23% don't go to church. So almost a quarter of young-Earthers aren't even religious. What's going on? What are the sociological forces keeping these ideas so strongly rooted in so many people's heads?On this week's podcast Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Alex Schmidt to cover the modern history of science deniers. We ask where they come from, why they are so prominent now, and if we have to think of science and myth as contradictory.Also, make sure to come to our next live podcast taping on Saturday, September 10th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, where Jack and the Cracked staff will flip-off movies like 'Sully' and 'Deepwater Horizon' and pitch some insane true stories that should be made into big Hollywood movies instead.

              <itunes:summary>Are you ever so overwhelmed by the thought of going out to socialize that you just stay home instead? And then once you stay home, you're bummed out at yourself for not leaving the house in the first place? Is your typical party maneuver to hang out in the corner pretending to text someone? Is the slow march of time a crippling experience that can only be made bearable by drinking alcohol and seeking out progressively more dangerous experiences?Oh. Whew. Us too!Seems that anxiety and depression are taking a bigger stranglehold of our culture and there are actually some statistics to back that up. Suicides are at a 30 year high, drinking is at a 25 year high, rates of depression are up 800 percent over 70 years and prescriptions for antidepressants were up 400 percent between 1988 and 2011. That's some grim shit. But we have a theory as to why this may be happening.Around some 200,000ish years ago, the human brain stopped evolving, but our culture hasn't. Rigorous jobs, ever-expanding social networks, complex societal problems have all made our lives more convoluted, but our brains were only designed to handle things like, "where's the fire?" and, "hey, there are some deer over there." Evolution has left us hanging and we don't know how to cope. For a multi-tiered deep-dive into this subject, Jack O'Brien is first joined by Cracked executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to discuss the increasing role of anxiety in our population. Later, Jono Zalay, the world's foremost comedian with a PhD in neuroscience, joins the conversation to talk about the role of drugs in this equation and some of the scientific reasons for why our brain needs anxiety.Also, make sure to come to our next live podcast taping on Saturday, September 10th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, where Jack and the Cracked staff will flip-off movies like 'Sully' and 'Deepwater Horizon' and pitch some insane true stories that should be made into big Hollywood movies instead.

              <itunes:summary>So after seven books, eight movies and a trip to Universal Studios, you think you would prefer to go to Hogwarts than live in real life. Everyone gets assigned a very useful pet owl, you can fly around on broomsticks and you don't have to stick to MLA formatting or learn differential geometry. Sounds great! Except everyone is dying all the time.  Cedric Diggory. Dead. Fred Weasley. Dead. Let's face it, if there was an evil wizard trying to put an end to humanity on the campus of Ohio State, people would stop going there.Just to recap – Hogwarts: Pros: magic and other cool stuffCons: death is everywhere.By this logic, our goal this episode is to figure out what would be the best fictional school to attend. We found that most schools in fiction have a much higher death rate than the normal high school or university. We'll take that into consideration. Co-hosts Jack O'Brien and Daniel O'Brien are joined by Cracked's Josh Sargent and Alex Schmidt, and comedians Alison Leiby, Brandie Posey, Riley Silverman and Steven Wilbur to talk Hogwarts, Starfleet Academy, Sunnydale High and more.Footnotes:Alison Leiby's Website:  https://goo.gl/Dk4XHS Alison Leiby's Standup:  https://goo.gl/nFm8P3 Brandie Posey's Website:  http://goo.gl/evH4MH Brandie Posey's Standup:  https://goo.gl/7gVzdI Riley Silverman's Website:  http://goo.gl/CNZZYj Riley Silverman's Standup:  https://goo.gl/ADU1qG Steven Wilber's Website:  http://goo.gl/OH9jB9 Steven Wilber's Standup:  https://goo.gl/8vJBl1 Cracked: The 5 Most Depraved Sex Scenes Implied By Harry Potter:  http://goo.gl/RVSM5 Cracked: 6 Horrifying Implications of the Harry Potter Universe:  http://goo.gl/uiaMd Cracked: Why Hogwarts Was All in Harry's Head:  http://goo.gl/xLALu Cracked: My Brief Time as a Student at Hogwarts:  http://goo.gl/M05Mm Cracked: After Hours: 5 Movie High Schools That Would Suck To Attend:  https://goo.gl/yNRe8H This episode is sponsored by Wealthfront Veritone, Magoosh, and the Now Hear This Podcast Festival.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Will Smith famously turned down the role of Neo in 'The Matrix', a decision that created the current timeline in which we live, where Obama is President, Prince is dead and Keanu Reeves is making awesome John Wick movies. Meanwhile Smith is playing second fiddle in poorly - reviewed DC expanded universe movies and is probably questioning  when it all went wrong. The chronicle of filmmaking is peppered with anecdotes like these; crazy what-ifs that had they gone the other way, maybe history wouldn't be totally different ,  but the movies we love would. On this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked columnists David Christopher Bell and Josh Sargent to talk about  some of these movie what-ifs and then take it one step further: think of some  disappointing movies  from the last few years that would be fixed with one simple change.Footnotes:Cracked: 6 Reasons 'Jurassic World' Killed Its Biggest Hero:  http://goo.gl/Kk4a7R Cracked: 4 Surprisingly Simple Fixes for Famously Bad Movies:  http://goo.gl/lVNbpG Cracked: 5 Famously Terrible Movies That Were Almost Great:  http://goo.gl/ZQAEFB  Cracked: 6 Famously Terrible Movies That Were Almost Awesome:  http://goo.gl/qYUf2 Cracked: 35 Last-Second Casting Changes That Altered Movie History:  http://goo.gl/RUak4z Cracked: 5 Movies That Were One Flaw Away From Being Classics:  http://goo.gl/PeHrn Bruce Willis' Crazy 'Red 2' Interview:  https://goo.gl/Kc5rxj Film School Rejects: The 8 Worst Parts of Prometheus Made Sense in the Original Script:  https://goo.gl/7T8MU6 This episode is sponsored by Magoosh, Spotify, Loot Crate, and the Now Hear This Podcast Festival.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>So you think you know how the world works, right? You watch one episode of 'Mythbusters' and suddenly you're an expert on ballistics, germ theory and aeronautical engineering.Tell me then, Jonas Salk, why you always get sick on airplanes. You're probably thinking it has something to do with the recycled air. Five hours spent breathing the same diseased air as the commoners back in coach and you're bound to come down with something, right? Wrong, you aristocratic pig!You can actually blame the airlines and flight attendants for this one. Don't you think it's weird how the plane gets clean in the 20 minutes between when the plane lands and when they ask you to board? Yeah, that's because they don't clean it. Every surface on an airplane is a plastic germ-ridden hellscape trying to eat you from the insides out. That's why you get sick when you fly.There are plenty of other everyday systems and things whose inner workings are taken for granted like that. Jack O'Brien is joined this week by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Kristi Harrison for a roundup of things that don't work how you'd expect: from airplanes, to soap, to the world economy.Also, make sure to join us at our next live podcast taping!Tickets are just $5 and are available  here:  https://goo.gl/QtlWid  Footnotes:USA Today: 5 Myths About Germs on Airplanes:  http://goo.gl/7KrnF7 Slate: How Welfare Reform Failed:  http://goo.gl/CIB1S1 And The Band Played On (Book):  https://goo.gl/OkI1Qx And The Band Played On (Movie):  https://goo.gl/KRZvfz Oklahoma vs. Harvard Debate (Start at 0:43):  https://goo.gl/3bDplo Cracked: 6 Inside Facts About Jeopardy From a 74-Episode Winner:  http://goo.gl/gRKtzC Cracked: 6 Counterintuitive Tricks to Beating Popular Game Shows:  http://goo.gl/f9BDt The Economist: Age Invaders:  http://goo.gl/QL6q1J IMF: What Is The Demographic Dividend?:  http://goo.gl/aAobvU  This episode is sponsored by Spotify, Magoosh, Casper Mattresses, and Loot Crate.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Congratulations! You've died in a fictional universe where the afterlife exists! How cool is that? Aren't you happy you're not in the Tarantino-verse? Instead of your soul escaping to the great unknown, you get to hang out and make pottery with Whoopi Goldberg, contract the exorcism services of whatever Beetlejuice is, or get treated like vermin by a team of New York City exterminators (of indeterminate gender). So what will it be? What would be the best pop-culture afterlife to spend your eternity in? To figure that out, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Daniel O'Brien and Michael Swaim and comedian and artist Ramin Nazer. They also discuss some of the worst afterlife scenarios from ancient religions, create their own perfect afterlife and talk about who they'd haunt if they were ghosts.Also don't forget to buy tickets to our next live podcast taping on Saturday, August 13th at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles!In the muggle world, we're not given the opportunity for a magical hat to tell us which school we should go to. Usually we just have to go to the high school closest to where we live or whatever college accepts our SAT scores and personal essay. This month, our goal is to determine what would be the best fictional school to go to.Join Jack, Daniel, the rest of the Cracked staff and some special guests as they figure out if it's a realistic school like Degrassi or West Beverly High, or an institution from a fantasy world like Hogwarts with its ghosts and dementors, or Bayside High, haunted by a monster known only to humans as 'Screech.'Tickets are just $5 and are available  here:  https://goo.gl/QtlWid  Footnotes:Ray Kurzweil : The Coming Singularity:  https://goo.gl/WNqGFQ Simon Rich: "What In God's Name":  https://goo.gl/fXA3oo Ramin Nazer  : "After You Die":  https://goo.gl/jBeKGl  Rob Bryanton: "Imagining the Tenth Dimension":  https://goo.gl/bGPMvm The Fox Sisters and the Rap on Spiritualism:  http://goo.gl/jZPLub Andy Weir: "The Egg":  http://goo.gl/flww Christopher Moore: "Lamb"  https://goo.gl/7CVl3P  This episode is sponsored by Squarespace, Spotify, and Loot Crate.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>The prominent philosophers The Righteous Brothers once warned about "los[ing] that loving feeling," and the sentiment was famously echoed in the 1986 fighter pilot documentary 'Top Gun'. After having lost said loving feeling, the brothers (not actually brothers) felt as if they couldn't go on. The sensation they felt wasn't poetic exaggeration. The Righteous Brothers, along with brothers Maverick and Goose were experiencing a very real and potentially dangerous biological response known as skin hunger.Skin hunger is your body's reaction to lack of physical touch and it affects an increasing number of Americans while being a non existent phenomenon in more touch-happy countries like France. The problem that we're learning is that without skin-to-skin touch (might we add that it doesn't have to be sexual), your body doesn't produce the hormone oxytocin. Without that natural chemical, adults are more susceptible to depression and infants can have developmental problems or even die.On this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien and Cracked editor Robert Evans are first joined by Dr. Kory Floyd, a professor at the University of Arizona, to talk about the physiological and sociological repercussions of skin hunger and why it's so prominent in today's culture. Later Jack and Robert are joined by Jean Franzblau of the Cuddle Sanctuary in Los Angeles and Travis Ashkenasy, an independent contractor, to talk about the services they provide as professional cuddlers and why you shouldn't be embarrassed to seek out a cuddle party.This episode is sponsored by Magoosh, The Bouqs, and Credit Karma.Footnotes:Psychology Today: What Lack of Affection Can Do to You:  https://goo.gl/HOlA9y Sebastian Junger TED Talk on PTSD, Loneliness:  https://goo.gl/e31gD3 NYT Book Review: Sebastian Junger's 'Tribe':  http://goo.gl/ysbAAd Tiffany Field's Book 'Touch':  https://goo.gl/oj4NzM Tiffany Field's Study of Touch at McDonald's in the US and France:  https://goo.gl/LxipQv Do High Fives Help Sports Teams?:  https://goo.gl/7OJlY9</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>There are parts of our daily lives that we just take for granted as being normal, but science proves us wrong. One of the best ways to look at this is language. We've previously discussed on the podcast how languages with future tenses (like English) make us really bad at planning for the future. We just think the future is some imaginary place that we'll always to go later. That's why we're great at fun things like procrastinating, drinking and smoking. Chinese, on the other hand, doesn't have tenses at all, so native speakers find themselves naturally better at planning for the time ahead. For Chinese speakers, the future isn't some magical fairy island that will always come tomorrow–the structure of the language just makes the consequences of life more immediate in their brains.These little cultural differences literally affect how we perceive the world. In languages with more words for the color green, for example, speakers can actually see more shades of green than us. What is a superpower to us is completely mundane to them because they've just had that language and ability their whole life.On this week's podcast Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to outline some of the scientific ways our brains trick us with this phenomenon-- how our sense perception, something we assume is uniform across all humanity, actually changes depending on what culture we're brought up in.Footnotes:Donald Trump/Bernie Sanders "Yuuuge" Forum Thread:  http://goo.gl/xNhQ4e Blue Square/Green Square Experiment:  http://goo.gl/08DBcL Cracked: Unexplained Things That Only Happen In A Few Places On Earth:  http://goo.gl/zf42ye Cracked: 7 Innocent Gestures That Can Get You Killed Overseas:  http://goo.gl/7Nv1es Cracked: 6 Mental Illnesses That Only Happen in One Place on Earth:  http://goo.gl/seibHn Cracked: 5 Insane Ways Words Can Control Your Mind:  http://goo.gl/RlnD Cracked: 5 Surprising Ways Your Language Affects How You Think:  http://goo.gl/3g3nBa Cracked: I Don't Know My Age: 5 Things I Learned in My Isolated Tribe:  http://goo.gl/6LdJIh Cracked: 6 Isolated Groups Who Had No Idea That Civilization Existed:  http://goo.gl/e49hK Invisibilia: McDonald's in Russia:  http://goo.gl/nBrjpd 99% Invisible: Devil's Rope:  http://goo.gl/VTbc2K The McGurk Effect:  https://goo.gl/T47EGZ The Atlantic: Can Your Language Influence Your Spending, Eating and Smoking Habits:  http://goo.gl/R9oI0m Schoolboy Q's Blankface LP on Spotify:  https://goo.gl/BgLM1a This episode is sponsored by Comic Con HQ, Magoosh, Spotify, and Loot Crate.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Do you find yourself getting irrationally mad when you're cut off by the car plastered in bumper stickers warning about the danger of contrails? When you're walking on a sidewalk and there's a group of people in front of you, do you want to run them over with a snowblower because they're arranged in such a way that it's impossible to navigate around them? When there's someone in a coffee shop talking loudly on their phone, do you want to plunge them and their stupid conversation to the bottom of the Mariana Trench for the rest of time? If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you're not being an asshole, that's just evolution baby. Apparently we're hard-wired to think people are jerks and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it. To commemorate the arrival of 'Difficult People' season 2 on Hulu, Jack O'Brien, Josh Sargent and Alex Schmidt discuss the scientifically proven ways humans are just awful–from our bad driving habits to the cognitive bias that proves why stupid people think they're smart. Trust us, it's not you, it's them. Footnotes: - David Dunning: We Are All Confident Idiots:  https://goo.gl/yclkfl  - Cracked: 6 Scientific Reasons People Drive Like Assholes:  http://goo.gl/gk4s  - Cracked: 5 Scientific Reasons You're a Bad Employee:  http://goo.gl/X5SD  - Cracked: 6 Obnoxious Behaviors That Make You Better at Your Job:  http://goo.gl/eorSF6  - Cracked: 5 Logical Fallacies That Make You Wrong More Than You Think:  http://goo.gl/XtQGF  - Robert Sapolsky - Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers:  https://goo.gl/Ji7S4G  - Watch Difficult People on Hulu:  http://goo.gl/ZHNQpt  - Difficult People on Instagram:  https://goo.gl/lLva2S  - Difficult People on Twitter:  https://goo.gl/TBdkeD  - Difficult People on Facebook:  https://goo.gl/fHma0d</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Watching movies like 'Speed' and 'The Negotiator,' you get the sense that talking a bad guy out of a hostage situation is a lot like being a Jedi. A little, "these aren't the droids your looking for," here, a little (insert witty line) there, and bam, you're making out with the foxy bank teller back at HQ by happy hour.Now if that were true, we'd all be hostage negotiators, right? But the job isn't that simple. It's much more passive than we think and involves a lot more teamwork than just one man walking into a building with only a bullhorn and his gut instinct.To learn what we all get wrong about hostage negotiators, Jack jack is joined by Chris Voss; author, professor and former lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI. They discuss how teamwork and active listening are two of the most important parts of the job, and then Chris explains how hostage negotiation skills can be used in business and in real life.Make sure to buy tickets to our next live podcast taping where we get heavy and talk about the afterlife, maaan! What if there's no heaven and hell and we're all just a hologram inside the mind of an ancient computer simulation? What if the Zoroastrians were right and it doesn't matter how good you are in your life, you just have to cross a rickety bridge guarded by two four-eyed dogs to reach eternal salvation?Join Jack, Dan, and Michael on Saturday, July 16th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles as they try to figure out what it all means. They'll be joined by comedians Casey Jane Ellison and Ramin Nazer to discuss their favorite afterlife scenarios from movies, sci-fi and lesser-known religions.This episode is sponsored by Harry's, The Bouqs, and Spotify.Tickets are only $5 and available here:  https://goo.gl/yvf76j Footnotes:Chris Voss: Never Split the Difference:  http://goo.gl/yCKrnz Daniel Kahneman: Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow:  https://goo.gl/GoGs3a The Atlantic: The Dark Side of Emotional Intelligence:  http://goo.gl/MjOC5N Cracked: 4 Aspects of Hostage Situations Movies Didn't Prepare Me For:  http://goo.gl/1wvR1h David Foster Wallace: This is Water:  http://goo.gl/XMEqj New York Times: Quiet Fixer in Donald Trump's Campaign:  http://goo.gl/BcQQsH</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Put on your white sneakers, drink some Kool-Aid and follow your Supreme Leader Jack O'Brien for a deep dive this week into the world of cults. There are so many cults all around us and they exist in many forms. The picture in your mind may be of a secluded ranch with some long-haired guy trying to sleep with as many women as possible, but that isn't the only type of cult out there. Yes there are your Scientologies and your Heaven's Gates, but Apple is a cult too. So is Disney. One of the most powerful cults in the world right now is ISIS. They have a government and an army, but their mission and ideology aligns more with a cult than with a country.All these facets of cultism are discussed on this week's show. Jack O'Brien is joined by author Karen Stollznow to discuss why America is such a good breeding ground for cults. Later, author Steven Hassan talks about mind control and how he now spends his time counseling former cult members.Make sure to buy tickets to our next live podcast taping where we get heavy and talk about the afterlife, maaan!

              <itunes:summary>In a way, science-fiction has not only predicted the future but created it as well. The works of Jules Verne inspired the first submarines and Star Trek's communicators and tablets clearly inspired the smart phones and computers and voice-activated assistants we use today. But there's still so much we don't have yet.Space colonies, faster-than-light travel, teleportation, genetic manipulation -- there's so much cool stuff we see in movies and TV that still seem decades if not centuries away. Sex bots! There are sex bots in everything, but look around-- there are no sex bots to be found. A real tragedy.So this week we're going to play pretend and talk about the tropes and imagery from sci-fi that we wish were a reality. Jack O'Brien and co-host Adam Tod Brown are joined by Cracked's Tom Reimann and Josh Sargent as well as comedians David Huntsberger, Caitlin Gill and Lizzy Cooperman to talk robots, generation ships, babies with grasshopper legs and more in this exploration of the sci-fi stuff we really want but probably can't have. This episode is sponsored by Wiener-Dog from IFC Films, Spotify, Harry's, and The Bouqs.Footnotes:- 'This Perfect Day' by Ira Levin:  https://goo.gl/r6UaVB - i09: How the L5 Society Tried to Use a Quirk of Physics to Colonize Space:  http://goo.gl/0jgQSW - Cracked: 6 Disasters With Details So Awful, History Left Them Out:  http://goo.gl/Kdw3WS - Tor: 5 Books About Generation Ships:  http://goo.gl/sTLLnX - Mystery Science Theater 3000 - Space Mutiny:  https://goo.gl/hC5BVB - Mystery Science Theater 3000 - Blood Waters of Dr. Z:  https://goo.gl/CluthX - National Geographic: 'Evacuate Earth':  https://goo.gl/EA3IJz - Star Wars Holiday Special:  https://goo.gl/2Lk51E</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>We have a lot of phrases for describing large groups of humans, and none of them are good. We fear the mob mentality and use words like 'herd' or 'sheep' to describe how dumb we can get in big groups. But what if there were a way to harness our collective intelligence and use it to amplify our best qualities instead of our worst?That's what Louis Rosenberg did when he founded Unanimous AI, a company that looked at how swarms of bees make decisions, and developed a program to allow humans to make decisions and predictions in the same way. Instead of voting, decisions are made as a collective.Okay, but what do you do with this, you ask? Using swarm intelligence, Unanimous AI was able to predict the Kentucky Derby, the Oscars and routinely beats Las Vegas oddsmakers when predicting sports like hockey and football.Rightly amazed by this awesome new superpower, Jack O'Brien chats with Louis about how his technology works, how it was modeled off the behavior of honey bees, and the surprising things it found about human morality.Footnotes:Francis Galton, 'Vox Populi':  http://goo.gl/4TMOAL  The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki:  https://goo.gl/4ULXJQ  Wisdom of the Crowd: Myths and Realities:  http://goo.gl/nBVpZb UNU Publications:  http://goo.gl/op1MWX This episode is sponsored by Blue Apron and Casper Mattresses.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Fan theories are kind of our thing. We talk about them on this podcast ( https://goo.gl/dZXW05 ) and in our articles ( http://goo.gl/dSyV31 ). We even created After Hours ( https://goo.gl/uQqjmK ), a whole series dedicated to fleshing out even the most unrealistic interpretations of our favorite TV shows and movies. But rarely do the creators of the pop culture we love reach out to us about our theories.A few months ago we released an After Hours episode ( https://goo.gl/aFfIAr ) where we presented some pretty out-there speculations about the Simpsons universe. We thought Bart, Lisa and Marge represented Freud's id, ego and superego, and we thought the universe as a whole was populated by thousands of clones. Little did we know how wrong we were.We thought they were fun what-ifs, but long-time Simpsons writer Mike Reiss emailed us to tell us our theories were pure fantasy. So we thought we'd have him on the podcast! Mike along with Simpsons writer Jeff Martin sit down with Jack O'Brien, Dan O'Brien and Michael Swaim for a long discussion about Simpsons fan theories and the origins of some of our favorite episodes and jokes.Footnotes:Every Episode of The Simpsons:  http://goo.gl/cbSi8E List of Simpsons Scholarly Articles :  http://goo.gl/QLqNBc</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Here are some words you usually don't find in the same sentence: rocket science, orgies, jet propulsion, and the occult. Believe it or not, the beginning of modern rocket science wasn't helmed by some nerds in a laboratory, but by a group of rockstar scientists who blew stuff up by day and did drugs and animal sacrifices at night. Jack Parsons was the leader, and in his short life he fought with L. Ron Hubbard over women, led a branch of an occultist religion and founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.Parsons is just one of the many consequential people we discuss on this week's podcast who shaped the modern era, but had life stories that you wouldn't believe. Jack O'Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by comedian and host of 'Paranormal You & Me' Ryan Singer to delve into the life and beliefs of Parsons, and discuss others such as George Washington's femme fatale superspy and the Russian officer who prevented the end of the world.Also make sure to buy tickets to our next LIVE podcast taping on Saturday June 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles!Every summer we're treated to the same buffet of three or four science fiction movies with the same basic conceits.

              <itunes:summary>Sorry to get personal, but which way do you wipe? The only reason we ask is because a recent thread ( http://goo.gl/49Viln ) melted the Cracked.com forums when our dear readers realized that people had slightly different bathroom preferences than them.As we looked upon the carnage, we realized there are so many insignificant topics that people feel almost violently confident about: hanging your toilet paper over or under, oxford commas, whether to say 'the' before the number of a freeway. No matter which side of the aisle you come down on, you know that anyone who disagrees with you is wrong and should probably be sent via a rocket into the sun.These insignificant topics are what we're talking about on this week's podcast. Special guest-host Soren Bowie is joined by Cracked's Cody Johnston and Michael Swaim and comedian Annie Lederman for a graphic conversation about what these topics are and why they're so easy to fight over.Also make sure to buy tickets to our next LIVE podcast taping on Saturday June 11th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles!Every summer we're treated to the same buffet of three or four science fiction movies with the same basic conceits.

              <itunes:summary>If you know that the early bird gets the worm, I'm sure you also know to stop and smell the roses, that an apple a day keeps the doctor away, and variety is the spice of life. Or maybe not, because those are all completely contradictory and made up by who, exactly? Some sort of internal rhyme shaman or sarcastic centuries-old grandmother?Where the hell did we get all these idioms from? A stitch in time saves nine? Turns out we've been saying that one wrong, there should be a comma in there. Don't put all your eggs in one basket? Well, I only have two hands, how many baskets should I be carrying? These situational little quips make us feel better in very specific moments, but the amount of them that seem to be direct opposites lead us to believe maybe none of them are worthwhile. On this week's episode, Jack O'Brien is joined by Michael Swaim to pour through the dozens of axioms that, when you think about them for a little bit, don't really give the best advice. Later they open up Poor Richard's Almanack, the 18th century source for many of these proverbs, and go through some of the sayings that didn't quite make it to the 21st century.Footnotes:Quotes from 'Poor Richard's Almanack':  https://goo.gl/MUCZ4m Source Amnesia:  https://goo.gl/PNIf9W Fake Kurt Vonnegut Speech:  http://goo.gl/TgT9Xg Richard Dawkins' 'The Selfish Gene':  https://goo.gl/n8BTJA Nicolo Machiavelli's 'The Prince':  https://goo.gl/wKZV75 5 Famous Wise Sayings That Are Secretly Dumb:  http://goo.gl/uVM6p2 5 Bits of 'Common Knowledge' Science Has Disproved:  http://goo.gl/apg2r1 6 Famous Movie Wisemen Who Were Totally Full of Shit:  http://goo.gl/mgBo 5 Staples of Wisdom That Need To Be Retired:  http://goo.gl/TMBDbH 7 Quotes By Famous Geniuses (That Everyone Gets Wrong):  http://goo.gl/imTECQ This episode is sponsored by Harry's and Adam and Eve.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>When you picture a serial killer, what do you think of? Do you think of Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant and sophisticated doctor who treats murder with the joy of a foodie at a gourmet mac & cheese bar? Or do you think of John Doe from 'Seven', a man who goes out of his way to create the most elaborately constructed crime scenes in order to make a thematic point to the police?Either way, you're probably imagining someone way more competent than an actual serial killer. Real murder is messy, and the real reason serial killers get away with what they do is because they're brilliant at feigning human emotion. Evil, yes, but they're not super-geniuses, laughing maniacally at a collage of pictures and string on a wall.On this week's episode, Jack O'Brien is joined by Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, the hosts of the podcast 'My Favorite Murder' ( http://goo.gl/gpaZN8 ) to discuss the common assumptions we get wrong about serial killers, theories surrounding the JFK, RFK, and JonBenet Ramsey murders and, of course, some of their favorite murder stories.Footnotes:- HBO's Tales of the Grim Sleeper:  https://goo.gl/t9yLF4 - Popular Crime by Bill James:  http://goo.gl/X6w1HC - The Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule:  http://goo.gl/MywKqw - The Sociopath Next Door by Martha Stout:  http://goo.gl/aXatW8 - Nikolai Dzhumagaliev (Metal Fang):  https://goo.gl/qiwnur - Metal Fang Escapes:  http://goo.gl/zAGKGZ - Latest DNA Evidence in JonBenet Ramsey Case:  http://goo.gl/GI2Uy7 - Possible CIA Involvement in RFK Assassination:  http://goo.gl/bCKS54 - Lost RFK Photos:  http://goo.gl/9agV9 - Souflikar the Strangling Executioner:  http://goo.gl/xYMmK - Hinterkaifeck Urban Legend:  http://goo.gl/iYAg2p - Cropsey:  http://goo.gl/szUCjU - Woman Fed Her Own Dog: http://goo.gl/iYAg2p - Hikers Killed in Avalanche:  http://goo.gl/xpSo - Woman Murdered in Penn State Library:  http://goo.gl/iYAg2p</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Why do we think Ned Flanders is so lame? He's outgoing and nice, is always happy to lend out his lawn equipment and looks amazing in ski-wear. Let's first start off by saying, no, the theme behind this episode is not why left-handed people are lame, but we are talking about giving hugs and high fives, staying away from cigarettes and alcohol, loving thy neighbor and all of the attributes we normally credit to boring people. Unfortunately for many of our dear readers and listeners, it's actually scientifically proven that working hard and having less fun leads to a longer, healthier life. On this week's episode, Jack O'Brien, Josh Sargent and Alex Schmidt discuss the ways that uncool behavior is actually beneficial to both the individual and society overall. They try to figure out why, despite all this, our culture still loves the bad boy and thinks nice guys finish last.Footnotes: Allure of the Antihero:  http://goo.gl/tNJz7M Do High Fives Help NBA Players?:  https://goo.gl/7OJlY9 LA Times: Why Loma Linda Residents Live Longer:  http://goo.gl/S9s5Jk Wired: Why Some Animals Are Becoming Nicer:  http://goo.gl/Lbh3nP Terror Management Theory:  https://goo.gl/2KEAcy Gizmodo: Why Do People Take Selfies in Emergencies?:  http://goo.gl/nUJzBG Cracked: 5 Sucker Behaviors That Secretly Give You an Advantage:  http://goo.gl/40LAcN</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Though they often seem to be lacking in self-awareness, Americans are well-acquainted with their own stereotypes. Yes, we get it; we're loud, we're brash, we're fat, we love NASCAR and think everyone should speak gosh darn American. These stereotypes in a way are almost self-imposed. We see 'Team America' and we assume that sardonic parody of patriotism is how the rest of the world views us, but that's not always the case.There are tons of stereotypes about Americans we have no idea about because they're things that are so normal to us we don't even notice them. Take cheese, for example. We LOVE cheese, and sure, other countries love it too, but to an Easterner, cheese is a gross, spongy, smelly alien substance. We know our political system is definitely on the wacky side of things, but do we even comprehend how our election looks to the rest of the world, nervously praying Donald Trump doesn't get the nuclear codes?On this episode, we're joined by a few foreigners to talk about all the weird things we do as Americans, but have no idea about. Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined by Japanese comedian Aiko Tanaka and British comedian Katia Kvinge to talk about our weird food culture and our even weirder dating culture. Later, Jack is joined by Cracked editor and resident Canadian Mark Hill to talk about why American technology lags far behind along with our politics.Footnotes:6 Ways US Elections Look Insane To Non-US Citizens:  http://goo.gl/sBRH9L 18 Simple Ways Other Countries Are Just Better Than America:  http://goo.gl/n8DdqW 19 Ways Americans Don't Realize Life In America Isn't Normal:  http://goo.gl/LtRu9k Deep inside us all behind our political leanings, our moral codes and our private biases, there is a cause so colossally stupid, we surprise ourselves with how much we care. Whether it's toilet paper position, fedoras on men or Oxford commas, we each harbor a preference so powerful we can't help but proselytize to the world. Guest host Soren Bowie will be joined by Cody Johnston, Michael Swaim and comedian Annie Lederman to discuss the most trivial things we will argue about until the day we die.

              <itunes:summary>Two years ago we told you the tales of some of the most badass people lost to the annals of history. There was Peter Freuchen, the 6'7" Danish explorer who clawed his way out of an ice cave using a shovel he made out of his own feces; and Elmer Keith, who could shoot objects from hundreds of yards away with the accuracy of a sniper, except he could do it with a revolver, one of the least accurate guns you could use in long-range. That episode ( https://goo.gl/nyhS0s ) was so popular and there were so many people we had to leave out, it was absolutely imperative we come back with more epic stories of incredible people you've probably never heard of. Just to name a few, this year, we have a crazy land mine defuser, a ruthless pirate queen and a gay revolutionary war hero who was half Rambo/half Santa Claus. Co-hosts Jack O'Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Cracked writers Alex Schmidt, Carmen Angelica, Josh Sargent and Tom Reimann, and comedians Ian Abramson and Blake Wexler. It's a heroic tournament-style podcast where one person will be crowned the ultimate unknown badass, winning a very special prize of our temporary respect and adoration.Footnotes:Cracked: 5 Spies With Bigger Balls Than James Bond (#4 Fritz Duquesne):  http://goo.gl/mORjz Short Biography of Sybil Luddington:  http://goo.gl/P4aAQu Short Biography of Tisquantum:  http://goo.gl/Zw6QHe CNN Profile of Aki Rah:  http://goo.gl/m4QAAd Baron von Steuben's Biography:  http://goo.gl/jr3cDw The Life of PT Barnum, Written by Himself:  http://goo.gl/jhd5xN  Rama Sukana and the Mythical Origins of Pencak Silat:  http://goo.gl/sZygVs Short Biography of Ching Shih:  http://goo.gl/Mskvcv</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>If you could go anywhere in time to live the rest of your life, where would you go? It probably depends on what you're looking for. Would you be looking to live in a time of relative peace, a time of great technological advancement, or simply a time where there wasn't some horrible plague killing off everybody you know and love? Doc Brown thought he had it all in the 1880s, but that period probably wouldn't be super awesome if you were a woman or a minority. Actually most time periods would be pretty bad in those circumstances. Not to mention that humans knew nothing about medicine and just generally not dying all the time until very recently. So obviously it's a difficult question with an unclear answer: when was the best time in human history to be alive? Hell, the answer might just be today. As in, whatever day you're reading this. This is the best day. To figure out this question, Jack O'Brien is first joined by Peter Stearns, author and professor at George Mason University to talk about the place of happiness in human history: which civilizations had it, which didn't, and when and where were they? Later, Jack talks about Cracked Podcast pet subject the Flynn Effect with none other than Jim Flynn, the guy who put his name on it. If every generation is getting slightly smarter than the last, how does that affect quality of life, and is there a limit to how smart humans can get?Footnotes:Peter Stearns, 'Teaching Consumerism in World History':  http://goo.gl/dO3XrD The Flynn Effect Summary of Findings:  http://goo.gl/AYYIYO Smithsonian Interview with James Flynn:  http://goo.gl/rX1AZn James Flynn's Torchlight Reading List:  http://goo.gl/iVkaLY James Flynn TED Talk:  https://goo.gl/i6vw2v</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>If you're afraid big corporations will one day try to beam ideas directly into your mind, too late. They've been doing this for years and you haven't even noticed it. Think about your grocery store. Right after you walk in, there's probably fresh flowers and produce. That's because supermarkets know that if you see fresh stuff when you walk in, you'll want to buy more food. There are subtle design features built into almost every facet of day-to-day life that are specifically engineered to get you to think a certain way, behave a certain way, and buy more stuff. This might sound like the ravings of someone whose car is covered in conspiracy theory bumper stickers, but once you start to notice the patterns and the reasoning, you'll see it everywhere.This week Jack O'Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss how supermarkets, car companies, local governments and more use mind control every day without you even realizing it.Footnotes:Magazine Covers With Obscured Wedding Rings:  http://goo.gl/NP4SVz Slate: "It Ain't Easy Being Green":  http://goo.gl/w6TdNN 5 Ways Stores Use Science To Trick You Into Buying Crap:  http://goo.gl/2Qz0O 8 Gadgets That Lie To You Every Day:  http://goo.gl/5H265 The 5 Most Hilariously Drug-Fueled Celebrity Interviews Ever:  https://goo.gl/hKv3pc Snopes: Instant Cake Mixes and Eggs:  http://goo.gl/Ima0d 5 Creepy Forms of Mind Control You're Exposed to Daily:  http://goo.gl/cx2Nr 5 Creepy Ways Your Town Is Designed to Control Your Mind:  http://goo.gl/4x6IL7 Vote for Cracked at the Webby Awards!Best Online Film & Video Entertainment Channel:  https://goo.gl/4v4ZrH Best Humor Website:  https://goo.gl/9bPgYE</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>On this special BONUS episode of The Cracked Podcast, we've got no mind-blowing views on social anthropology or insane fan-theories about how many Martys died for 'Back to the Future' to make sense. Instead of dissecting the movies this week, we thought we should go straight to the source and talk to directors themselves about how their films are inspired and made. Recorded in Austin, Jack O'Brien sits down with three filmmakers for intimate conversations about their respective SXSW premiere films. First, Jack musters up the courage to talk to one of his favorite directors, Jeff Nichols, about the Southern and Speilbergian influences in his new sci-fi film 'Midnight Special'. Jack is then joined by writer/director/actor Linas Phillips for a wide-ranging conversation about his film 'Rainbow Time', and how it truthfully depicts the mentally challenged, family, and sex. Finally, Jack, along with Cracked's Soren Bowie and Daniel O'Brien, sit down for a hilarious conversation with comedian/writer Henry Phillips about his movie 'And Punching the Clown' and how it farcically weaves together elements of his stand-up, his music and his real life.

              <itunes:summary>In the grand scheme of human history, awareness of mental health issues is a relatively recent development. It wasn't even until the 60s and 70s that therapy, medication and other modern treatments became mainstream. Before that we would just throw people in the looney bin, give them electro-shock therapy or pull out all their teeth if they were schizophrenic or suffering from depression. So it goes without saying that there were multitudes of people throughout history who were suffering from autism, addiction, bipolar disorder, ADHD and so on who were never treated. Many of these people went on to do great things– sometimes because of and sometimes in spite of their mental conditions. They were our Beethovens, our Lincolns, our Jeffersons and our Einsteins. This week we're taking a look into the past and shining a light on the famous historical figures you may not know were suffering from major mental illnesses. Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien first speaks with Claudia Kalb, a medical and science journalist who literally wrote the book on the subject, about Abraham Lincoln, Andy Warhol, Marilyn Monroe and whether modern treatments are medicating away the next generation of greats like these. Jack then speaks with Cracked editor Robert Evans about how many of these diseases may have evolved and benefitted prehistoric society, and the surprising way Syphilis ties into all of this.Footnotes:Claudia Kalb's 'Andy Warhol Was a Hoarder':  http://goo.gl/ROcX2E 5 Insane Celebrity Conspiracies That Make Sense (#3 Thomas Jefferson Had Asperger's):   http://goo.gl/u2BwC Michel Foucault's 'Madness and Civilization':  https://goo.gl/AqBts4 Robert Sapolsky's Lecture on OCD and Religion:  https://goo.gl/UJl7So 'Eating Christmas in the Kalihari':  http://goo.gl/ZZAW5R Buy tickets to our next live episode taping on April 9th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles:  https://goo.gl/VeEDmF</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>We tend to think of the class system as money thing. Rich people are high-class, poor people are of a lower class, and those things can change with the purchase of a lottery ticket or one bad financial investment. But that common understanding of class in America is not really how things work.Think of how many lottery winners are bankrupt within years because they overspend on frivolous things that would seem impressive to their own class. That explains Donald Trump's rise to political power. He's basically the lower class idea of wealth: he owns golf courses and casinos, has his name on everything, and is obsessed with gold. To your Vanderbilts or Rockefellers, he's a clown, but to lower class people, his lifestyle is something to strive for.On this week's episode Jack O'Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) take a deep dive into how we perceive class in America, what most people get wrong about it, and the surprising ways class is confused with race.Footnotes:Siderea on Economic and Social Class in America:  http://goo.gl/tlmX4S Slate Star Codex's Entry Summarizing Siderea's Piece:  http://goo.gl/2eYdF6 Slate Star Codex: I Can Tolerate Anything Except the Outgroup:  http://goo.gl/ZrwgcS The Atlantic's Review of 'Class: A Guide Through The American Status System':  http://goo.gl/G04Jzg Buy tickets to our next live episode taping on April 9th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles:  https://goo.gl/VeEDmF</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Last week on the site, Daniel O'Brien told us why Pinocchio was a  secretly terrifying tale  about a monster-boy thrust into existence by a bumbling old man who probably shouldn't be anyone's legal guardian.  To become a real boy, he's expected to prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish. But he's like, 30 seconds old, how would he know anything about that? None of us have these virtues and we're not wooden little puppet-devils.Inspired by last week's video, Jack O'Brien, Daniel O'Brien and Soren Bowie sit down for a conversation about the ways children's entertainment was either secretly horrifying, or simply giving us awful life-lessons. They talk about how the Nickelodeon shows of the 90s led to a generation of depressed loners, JK Rowling's subtle misanthropy, how the early Disney princesses were awful representations of women, and how Winnie the Pooh set back how we deal with mental health.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Ever since we started letting friendly wolves and tiny tigers into our homes a few thousand years ago, society has been split into two camps: dog people and cat people. Sometimes the battle lines are drawn across gender lines; the term cat-lady evokes an image in your head in a way cat-man doesn't. We use the word dog to colloquialize a sly, rakish man. Often we choose sides purely based on what our parents allowed in the house when we were kids. But rarely we stop to consider all the crazy superpowers our pets have: like how dogs can read human emotions better than other humans can, and how a cat's purr can improve your bone density. Recorded live at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, Team Dog (Jack O'Brien, Dan O'Brien, Cody Johnston), Team Cat (Carmen Angelica, Jake Weisman) and Team Turtle (Alex Schmidt) go back and forth with rarely-known facts about the pets we keep at home to decide who is the ultimate victor in this war that has been waged for millennia. Team Cat will blow up the way you think about the gender binary, and we may decide after it all that the best pet to have is a pig.Footnotes:Proof that Cats Destroy the Ecosystem:  http://goo.gl/6UB35 Cats' Purring Improves Bone Density:  http://goo.gl/B4Dr0e Pigs Have Higher IQs than Dogs, Chimps:  http://goo.gl/92xdEr Why Dogs Look at the Right Side of Your Face:  http://goo.gl/VN3p3J Cat Owners More Likely to Have Advanced Degree:  https://goo.gl/PirgYj Toxoplasma Gondii's Effect on Humans:  http://goo.gl/Cg0TX5</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>A few weeks ago we presented you some stories about a terrifying underground industry in America. An industry in which middle and upper-class families pay tens of thousands of dollars to have their children kidnapped in the middle of the night and sent to rehabilitation centers. These 'troubled' teens ares sent away for reasons ranging from getting caught smoking pot, to getting bad grades, to having a new step-parent that just plain doesn't like you. These unregulated rehab centers across America are often hyper-religious and don't require their counselors to have any formal training, resulting in systematic mental, physical and sometimes sexual abuse. The worst part is: the parents have no idea. They're told ahead of time that their kids will lie, beg and make up tall tales to get out of these camps, and to ignore these pleas as it's all part of the healing process. While preparing for our  podcast  a few weeks ago, we came across a story so harrowing and unbelievable, we just had to make it it's own episode. Jack O'Brien and Robert Evans are joined by Darlene Molina, who recounts her story of being sent to two camps, getting kicked out of one, and escaping the other. Also make sure to get your tickets to the next live podcast taping on Wednesday, March 9th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset Theatre. Jack O'Brien, Carmen Angelica, Dan O'Brien, Alex Schmidt, and Jake Weisman will discuss all the ways our dogs and cats are more powerful, creepy, and awesome than we ever could have imagined.

              <itunes:summary>If you go back one hundred or even fifty years ago to ask kids what they wanted when they grew up, they'd say they wanted to have families and to have good jobs. Now when you ask that question to kids the resounding answer is, "to be famous." Not to be a famous actor or a famous musician or athlete, just to be famous. And in our culture being famous is an easy reality. There are real Twitter and Vine and Instagram celebrities, but in a way we're all the star of our own curated reality show, broadcast over Facebook updates and Snapchat stories. We have a word for this kind of self-aggrandizing behavior-narcissism-but sometimes we use that word to mean "asshole" or "jerk" when there's an actual clinical meaning behind it that's much more complicated than the informal insult. Narcissism is a diagnosable condition that statistically only 1% of the population has. But why does it seem people are becoming more self-obsessed, more vain, more arrogant? In this week's episode, Jack O'Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) flesh out the theory that narcissism has become our cultural status quo. They discuss the differences between clinical narcissism and our colloquial version of the word; how Hitler, Trump, Jobs and countless other celebrities were certified narcissists; and how narcissism plays a part in Harry Potter and the new Star Wars.Articles Referenced in this Episode: The Last Psychiatrist on narcissism as a generational pathology :  http://goo.gl/AsODT  David Wong's article on the Monkeysphere :  http://goo.gl/x15H  Pictures of Hitler in 1925 rehearsing his speeches in front of a mirror :  http://goo.gl/Iqz8UQ  Tony Zhou on 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' :  https://goo.gl/307L9G  The full version of 'My Dinner with Andre' on YouTube :  https://goo.gl/mr8YFm</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Sorry, the Oscars, but you're old, out of touch and boring. We can see through your failed attempts to reach a new generation: the Anne Hathaway/James Franco catastrophe, the phony (get it?) Ellen DeGeneres selfie stunt that was totally unscripted and Samsung definitely didn't pay the Oscars $20 million in advance for. Just stop it already. Take a few years off.In the meantime, we at Cracked have come up with a bunch of new categories that you're totally free to steal, such as Best Title, Best Running Time, Best Accent and Best Oscar-Bait That Didn't Get Any Nominations Other Than This One.Recorded live at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, a tuxedoed Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Dan O'Brien and Alex Schmidt, author Liana Maeby, and actor Stanley Wong of 'The Big Short' to brainstorm new categories, solve the Oscar's race problem, and fix just about everything in time forSunday's awards.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Where Western medicine ends is often the place where eye-rolling begins. Just the mere mention of alternative medicine brings up imagery of snake-oil salesmen, chakras and crystals. But in the modern world, we're so devoted to the materialistic side of science–the stuff that can only be measured and doled out in pill form–we forget how much we don't know about how the human body works.Don't get us wrong, Western medicine is great! We can heal bones, prescribe medications and implant devices that can make the deaf hear again. But when it comes to dealing with dementia, autism, strokes, or anything inside the brain, we might as well be in the middle ages. How can we help a child locked inside his own mind when we barely understand what the mind is? How can we ethically take a comatose person off life support when your best guess for the definition of consciousness is as good as ours?Jack O'Brien is joined in-studio this week by David Huntsberger, host of the now-defunct podcast Professor Blastoff, for a very heady conversation about consciousness, the brain, the mind, and searching for therapies at the edge of Western medicine.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>You've probably seen 'scared straight' segments on some daytime talk show like 'Maury' before. You know the kind where they throw troubled teens in jail for a day to get yelled at by a drill instructor and come out crying for their parents?What if we told you there was a whole industry set up around this where you can legally have your child kidnapped in the night and sent to the wilderness or to live in a religious group home for months on end? These programs prey on middle-to-upper-class families, operate where there are no child labor laws, and use torture, fear, and manipulation tactics to "fix" troubled youth. Also the counselors need no formal training and are often child molesters.The best case scenario if you're a teenager sent to one of these camps is that you come home with PTSD and severe trust issues for the rest of your life, however in many cases you may just die there. It's one of the scariest things happening in America right now that you probably didn't know about.Cracked editors Jack O'Brien and Robert Evans speak with Maia Szalavitz, who literally wrote the book on the teen rehab industry, about how these centers operate and why so many families are conned into paying them thousands of dollars to hurt their kids. Then they speak with Sarah Cummins, whose family sent her to Utah to live in one of these centers where she was forced to manipulate other girls, do endless manual labor and hug her counselor who turned out to be a sex offender.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>The history of the music industry is littered with weird and possibly apocryphal stories of how people were discovered and how songs came to be. Sam Phillips, the man credited with discovering Elvis, tells the story of a shy 18-year-old Presley coming into his studio and Phillips having the gut instinct to shout something like, "say, this kid's gonna be a star!" It's a fine story, except Phillips wasn't even there the day Elvis first went into Sun Records. It was his assistant Marion Keisker who heard Elvis first and thought to pass him along to her boss. We like to think of our artists as chess pieces in a heroes journey. It fits the story in our minds to have Elvis be discovered by Obi-Wan Kenobi and for them to have the determination to know 'Hound Dog' would be a big hit. But 'Hound Dog' was first recorded 4 years earlier by Big Mama Thornton. The history of the music industry is a surprisingly messy thing. Keith Richards comes up with the main riff to 'Satisfaction' and forgets how to play it the next day. What sounds like divine inspiration to us might very well be an accident. On this week's podcast Jack sits down with Hrishikesh Hirway, the brilliant mind behind the podcast 'Song Exploder', to talk about his process and what he learns breaking down popular songs instrument-by-instrument. Later he talks with Peter Matthew Bauer of The Walkmen to talk gear culture, how demos are made, and Michael Jackson's magical $20,000 mixing board.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>A short list of completely ridiculous things we put up with as English speakers: 1. I before E except after C (apart from numerous exceptions that you should memorize)2. The letters C and K making the same sound (except when they don't)3. The multiple pronunciations of 'ough' (Cough, Through, Rough, Thought, etc.)4. Different countries putting a U in words like Favo(u)rite or Colo(u)rWhat the hell is going on here? How did our language get like this? Why is this the 2nd most spoken language in the world when it makes no sense? To get a grasp at the enormity of English, Jack O'Brien is joined on the phone by Susan Bennett, the original voice of Siri, to talk about her time recording every sound in the English language and how programmers put it all together.Later, Jack is joined onstage at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles by Dan O'Brien, Carmen Angelica and Alex Schmidt. They talk about the history of English, how it combines the best of French and the worst of German, the grammar's endless nonsensical rules, and some simple things other languages do that we wish we had.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>If you look back at the most popular comedies through the years, there are always parts that don't hold up. A lot of the time when it's a sex, bro, or gross-out comedy, the stuff that doesn't hold up is usually a cringeworthy scene or two where you think, "they could never do this today."For example, Vince Vaughn getting raped in 'Wedding Crashers' is played for laughs, but then we feel better about it at the end because he falls in love with his assailant. Shannon Elizabeth's Nadia in 'American Pie' is secretly taped getting naked and her character is deported for it while no punishment comes to the men who do this to her. The villain in 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' is trans woman outed by a bunch of grossed-out dudes. Funny!The fact that you can't get away with stuff like this anymore isn't a bad sign, or a sign that comedies are becoming PC or watered down. This is a good thing. It means we're not making fun of genders, races, sexual orientations at their expense for no reason.On this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Alex Schmidt to talk about some very recent movies, commercials and bits of pop-culture like these where what was once funny or en vogue is now horribly insensitive.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Remember when memes actually made sense and weren't just screencaps of Minions with text like, 'Obama: You Only Had One Job!' Remember when 'First World Problems' wasn't an excuse to complainbrag about your yacht running out of champagne? Remember when 'LOL' wasn't a mere punctuation mark and actually meant that someone was laughing out loud?Pepperidge Farm remembers. And now that meme is probably ruined too. The problem with the internet sometimes is that when creative, novel, and useful ideas get put into it, suddenly everyone has permission to reuse them. From there they get repeatedly misused, and before you know it, they completely lose all of their meaning. Literally. Or figuratively. We don't know because literally doesn't mean literally anymore.On this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Josh Sargent to talk about when great ideas go wrong and how the evolution of language and the internet drives them into the ground.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>As everything in the world becomes more interconnected and as the cost of recording and storing data sharply decreases, we've seen a steep rise in the importance of statistics. It seems like there isn't a single facet of human life that isn't quantifiable now that our phones and watches are counting each step and and calorie, while Facebook and Twitter collects each thought.If you don't think data is important, look what happens when we lose it, or realize we didn't even have it at all. In 2015 we had two major hacks in Sony and Ashley Madison, found out Volkswagen's data was a complete lie, and discovered we never were even tracking US police shooting deaths, which is completely *$@#ed.2015 was a huge year for both the data we had and the data we lost. In our final episode of the year, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien and Creative Director of Video Dan O'Brien are joined by FiveThirtyEight's Jody Avirgan, host of What's the Point, to recap the year in data.Also, be sure to buy tickets to our next LIVE podcast on Wednesday, January 6th at 7pm at the UCB Sunset theatre in Los Angeles.

              <itunes:summary>Take a trip in your mind back to May 18th, 1999. Bill Clinton was the president, 'Livin La Vida Loca' and 'No Scrubs' were at the top of the music charts, and there was hope that 'The Phantom Menace' would be a great movie. Then the next day happened; the movie was released, and a bit of our collective innocence was forever lost. There are  videos  of fans losing their shit with anticipation lining up to see the movie, and their reactions leaving the theater two hours later. Most said they loved it, but you can hear the twinge of doubt in their voices and see a blankness in their eyes, as if the brain was fighting itself, literally incapable of believing that the movie sucked. And in the coming years we obviously came to a consensus about the prequels: they were the most vile of garbage and George Lucas was persona non grata in the film industry.It's sixteen years later and we now hope we're in a different place, but it's easy to feel the parallels between where we are now and where we were in May 1999. We have no idea what 'The Force Awakens' will bring us later this week. We hope for the best, but also hope we're not too cynical in expecting the worst. On this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) for a deep dive into the history of Star Wars and how we got to this very moment. They discuss what the original trilogy got right, where the prequels went wrong, and the complicated genius of George Lucas.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>From 'Mad Max' to 'San Andreas' to 'The Avengers,' the most popular movies of our times are about how we fear our world will end. We're obsessed with stories of drought, natural disaster, nuclear war, zombies, aliens and robots. We fear the day science fiction turns into science fact, and while some movie apocalypses are basically pure make-believe, others seem eminently possible.So what are we doing about the threats of water and energy shortages? And are we destined to play out the doomsday scenarios we see in popular science fiction?In this special bonus episode taped live at the UCB Sunset theatre in Los Angeles, Jack O'Brien, Alex Schmidt and Michael Swaim are joined by three amazing guests to answer these questions and elaborate on the current state of the end of the world. On the science-fiction front, they're joined by Akiva Goldsman, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'I Am Legend'. And on the real science side, they're joined by Eric Fitch, whose company Purpose Energy is turning wastewater from beer into renewable energy, and Jon Freedman, whose working to shape international and domestic water policies on behalf of GE Water & Power.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>In 186 3, German chemist Julius Wilbrand was trying to make yellow dye and what he came up with was trinitrotoluene, also known as TNT . Twenty years went by until his creation was actually discovered to be explosive and another twenty went by until the first armies started using TNT to blow stuff up. So what was originally just a yellow dye for some lederhosen in the 19th century eventually became one of the most widely used and deadly explosives of the 20th. On this week's podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Kristi Harrison to share some of the various inventions and ideas throughout history that started off innocent, yet grew into something horrific. They talk about how a single letter in a medical journal started the heroin epidemic, how Hitler used America to model his empire, and how a conversation over a beer led to 160 million women disappearing from history.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>In Ron Howard's 1985 movie 'Cocoon,' a group of elderly people living in a Florida retirement community become magically rejuvenated by aliens. It plays out as a fantasy, a hilarious what-if scenario about old people acting young. The movie seems more fiction than science, but in the 30 years since the film's release, the branch of medicine devoted to curing aging has grown into possibly the next big thing.Aging has only been a problem since the beginning of time, a disease born into us by the very nature of being alive, but scientists believe we're not far off from therapies that could extend our lifespan by decades and keep us feeling like we're in our 30s the whole time.Jack O'Brien is joined by Laura Deming, a 21-year-old venture capitalist, who is funding the therapies of the future that will slow the process of aging. They discuss some of the breakthroughs in the field and Laura debunks some myths about current life extension treatments.Jack is then joined by Fiona Ginty, a principal scientist at GE working on the microimaging of cells. Fiona shares how this technology will aid in the fight against aging as that process might be built into our DNA.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Going back all the way to our very first episode, one of the topics that we've discussed most on this podcast is the Flynn Effect: the inevitability that each generation will be smarter than the last. We're smarter than a generation of people from the early 1900s and the future-people of the 2100s who ride driver-less cars and get wi-fi implanted into their eyelids will laugh at how dumb we are.Knowing this, the Flynn Effect would actually make time travel a bit more problematic than you thought. If you travel to the past, like Marty in 'Back to the Future III', in all likelihood you'd probably be burned as a witch or drawn and quartered for insisting the Earth traveled around the sun. If you go to the future, you'd be considered slow and thick-witted, that's if the people could understand you at all. You'd be Fry.Recorded live at the UCB Sunset theatre in Hollywood, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked's Dan O'Brien and Soren Bowie to analyze the horrifying intricacies of 'Back to the Future', and then move onto why time travel as a whole is probably not a good idea.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Search through the DVD extras of 'Back To The Future' and you'll come across one of the greatest what-ifs of movie history. The part of Marty McFly was originally played by Eric Stoltz (John Travolta's drug dealer from 'Pulp Fiction'), and they shot the movie for 5 weeks before ultimately replacing him with Michael J. Fox. The deleted scenes with Stoltz reveal a dour, contemplative Marty and the whole tone of the movie is off - like watching a Twilight Zone version of a movie you've seen 100 times before.This one casting change completely revamped the voice and quality of the movie for the better. In this vein, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Dan O'Brien and Soren Bowie to discuss the one simple change they would make to movies like 'The Dark Knight Rises' and 'Pacific Rim' that would make them infinitely better.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Let's talk about 'Inception': Christopher Nolan's least realistic movie up until 'Interstellar'. While commercially and critically loved, you got the sense watching it that this was something to suspend your disbelief for; that this world of shared dreaming, dreams within dreams and implanting false memories surely had no basis in fact or science. But what if we told you Nolan's half-baked ideas about the fallibility of memory were actually close to how the brain works? What if planting false memories in people was actually the most realistic part about 'Inception'?On this bonus episode of The Cracked Podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Steve Ramirez, a PhD student at MIT who actually incepted mice! With laser beams! They talk about that experiment and how it will shape the future of treating mental disorders. Jack is then joined by Dr. William Hirst, Professor of Psychology at the New School for Social Research, to talk about how utterly unreliable our memories are, even when trying to recall the most important moments of our lives.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>America is great at gentrification. Liberal oases like Portland and Austin are quickly being renovated to cover up their quirky charms, we knock down and rebuild stadiums to revitalize urban areas like it's our job and the city of San Francisco is basically one giant wifi-enabled Starbucks. But to think the organized displacement of low-income and minority communities is a 21st century invention is foolish. America has been the Lebron James of that game since the Mayflower!This week on the podcast Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Adam Tod Brown and Alex Schmidt to talk about America's history of forced gentrification, assimilation and deportation. The guys look at some of of the unique cultural communities completely wiped off the map by the course of history and examine the mechanism by which some populations are remembered and others are forgotten.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>In the last few years 'Edge of Tomorrow' and 'Elysium' showed near-futures where soldiers weren't limited by their physical capabilities, but instead were enhanced by mech-suits. It's a concept that provides for very entertaining movies, but considering we have no plans to fight hordes of aliens or wage a class war on the Lamborghini of space stations, can mech-suits have any real-life applications to us in the coming years? Or are they strictly limited to warfare? Let's say mech-suits do become a routine part of daily life. Will they help us for the better or just turn us into the soft and doughy humans like those aboard the starship Axiom in 'Wall-E'? Jack O'Brien ask all of these questions and more of Oliver Mayer, Principal Engineer at GE Global Research and an expert in robotics, who believes we're all a little bit cyborg already. Jack is then joined by Scott Novich, the co-founder and CTO of NeoSensory, Inc., a company helping the deaf hear by harnessing an underused sense: touch. From there, they talk about how this technology could potentially lead to humans gaining new senses.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Last year's worldwide Ebola outbreak brought into harsh reality the kind of imagery we typically only see in movies like 'Outbreak' or 'Contagion': the faceless officials in hazmat suits, the quarantine tents, the sudden fear of anyone who sneezes on an airplane. Though over 10,000 lives have been lost worldwide, it bears reminding the amount of US lives lost to the virus: one. So despite being bombarded with this cinematic imagery, it's clear in retrospect that we weren't in that much danger after all.Was our hysteria overblown? Or was the awareness brought on by the media panic the driving force behind the virus' containment?When our perception of pandemics has only ever been framed in the visual language of movies, it's hard to grasp the actual science behind how these things spread. In this special bonus episode of The Cracked Podcast, Jack O'Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) are joined by GE's chief medical officer Dr. David Barash to discuss Ebola's outbreak and containment, and the relationship between Hollywood pandemics and real ones. </itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Last year we covered in a podcast how truth is stranger and often scarier than fiction, especially when it comes to the history genre. Case in point: the story of Henry Rathbone. You're probably thinking, who's Henry Rathbone? That's kind of the point. Henry Rathbone and his wife Clara were sitting next to Abraham Lincoln the night of the assassination, and despite the decades of conspiracy theories and ghost stories surrounding the Lincoln family, the craziest and bloodiest story of the night belongs to Mr. Rathbone.See, in the years following Lincoln's assassination, Rathbone's mental state declined as he blamed himself for not being able to prevent the president's death. Soon after that, he started to believe his walls were talking to him. Then he went full Shining and murdered his wife, tried to murder his children and stabbed himself 5 times in the chest. He spent the rest of his life in an insane asylum. This is an absolutely bonkers story edited from the margins of history, yet we choose not remember it because it doesn't read like a textbook.This sort of historical amnesia also applies to how we look at the horror genre. There are countless unsolved murders, disappearances and mass hysterias that we don't know how to classify just because their details are too strange to swallow, the leads go nowhere and eventually we give up.So in honor of Halloween, Jack O'Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) share 12 creepy and macabre unsolved mysteries that are just too weird to fit into our cookie-cutter version of the horror genres.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
              <itunes:summary>Screws, in some form or another, have been around since the 3rd century BC, and it wasn't until the 1500s that screws began to start appearing in what we now accept as their modern form. They're a great, simple piece of technology that helps solve the problem, 'how do we secure this to that?'Throughout all that time, however, there was just one problem: no one had invented the screwdriver yet. It's true. People would spend entire lifetimes - generations would come and go - and all they could do to tighten a screw was use a coin or a flat piece of wood or something. It was like society as a whole had left their toolbox in the car but was too lazy to go out and get it.For every screwdriver we also get an iPhone: a device that, in an instant, crammed the future into the present and forever changed the course of human history.So there are screwdrivers, and then there are iPhones. Some came 300 years too late and others surprise us 300 years before we expect them. Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Tom Reimann and Alex Schmidt to discuss the many screwdrivers and iPhones of history that you may not know about.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Sometimes finding the presidential candidate that's right for you comes down to the endorsements. Are they supported by the teachers union or local firefighters? Maybe the endorsement of the New York Times means something to you.What if a major candidate this year, a certain blustery, orange-haired TV personality, had the endorsements of The Daily Stormer, American Renaissance and the League of the South, organizations whose political leanings fall somewhere between John Wilkes Boothe and Michael Fassbender in 12 Years A Slave? Why hasn't the Donald Trump bullet-train to the White House come to a screeching halt with the revelation that many of his advocates would rather it be 1850 than 2015?This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Adam Tod Brown and Robert Evans to discuss Donald Trump, the seeming rise of white supremacy around the globe, and secret Nazi dog-whistles. Later, Stephanie Georgopulos from Paper Magazine sits down with Jack for a one-on-one about Michael Jackson's racial identity and what it's like to grow up biracial in America.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Newsflash: You only have 407 days until the 2016 presidential election. Do you think you'll have enough time to make an informed decision? We think so. In fact, you could bury your head in the sand on Mars for another full year and still have enough time to suss out which candidate you think should be the leader of the free world.But why, over 13 months out, is every news outlet leading with an election story like it's coming up tomorrow and we still have approximately 45,000 candidates? Why are no serious Republican candidates calling out Trump for being a rodeo clown in a fancy suit? And why do people think Donald Trump can win when -- spoiler alert -- he's not going to become President?Dan O'Brien is joined this week by Cracked editors Kristi Harrison and Alex Schmidt to answer these burning questions and remind you that what's going on with the presidential election right now is a total farce; you can go back to your normal business until February 2016 at the earliest.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>As we've pointed out many times before, just because a movie advertises itself as "based on a true story," that doesn't mean you should take anything that happens in the movie for fact. We're good at spotting the dichotomy with insane horror movies that sell themselves as "inspired by actual events." We know that in real life the doll doesn't actually come alive and gore the family to death; that it's a construction of the horror movie genre. But why, when it's a biopic or a historical drama, do we automatically assume that we're essentially watching a documentary with contemporary actors?This week guest host Dan O'Brien is joined by author Liana Maeby and Cracked editor Josh Sargent to discuss the weird relationship between truth and fiction, expectation and reality, and movies that changed the real stories that inspired them for better or worse -- usually worse.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Think about the Disney princesses of the 1930s, 40s and 50s and what they actually accomplished in their films. Snow White: Hot girl falls asleep in the forest and is almost murdered by dwarfs until they realize how hot she is. Alice in Wonderland: English girl falls asleep at lunch, has crazy dreams, wakes up. Sleeping Beauty: Do you see where we're going with this?When you peel away your personal experiences with these movies and just think about their base elements, a dark subtext arises. The Disney filmography from the 1930s to today perpetuates an antiquated American value structure that depicts misogyny, racism, classism and narcissism, yet as kids watching these films and parents showing them to our children, we never think twice about it. Should we be more vigilant in deciphering what these movies are really about instead of just blindly trusting the logo on the Blu-Ray case?This week on the podcast Jack O'Brien and guest host Tom Reimann are joined by Cracked editors Alex Schmidt, Josh Sargent and Adam Tod Brown. They discuss the grim underpinnings of the Disney film library, how his earliest films are ripe with misogyny, and Jack's secretly horrifying childhood vacation to a Disney theme park.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Growing up we were taught to abide by the golden rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. But that's hard to maintain. People get in the way and always seem to let you down, right? A  co worker is a jerk to you and you don't know why. You hold a door for someone at the coffee shop and then that person and 15 of their friends all stand in front of you in line. What if there  were a simple hack to get  your enemies to work for you; some sort of jedi mind-trick for assholes?Well, lucky for you, that actually exists and Ben Franklin figured it out two centuries ago. He found that asking people he didn't get  get along with to do simple favors for him subconsciously forced them into liking him. It's kind of an anti-golden rule that doesn't flow off the tongue at all: Have others do unto you what you want and then they'll continue to do good unto you. ..or something like that. This week Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Alex Schmidt to discuss this "Ben Franklin effect" and why it explains some more troubling human behaviors like internet mob culture and why celebrities  slowly turn into their own personas.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Our main bread and butter at Cracked is pointing out the little things in movies that either brainwash our society as a whole, or are just simply so overused that they annoy the bloody hell out of us.  We've covered in our columns some of the movie clichés that bother us the most, like the slow clap or just about anything that happens in a dystopian YA movie.So this week we're dedicating a whole podcast to it. Live from the UCB Sunset theatre in Los Angeles, co-hosts Jack O'Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Soren Bowie, Cody Johnston and Dan O'Brien to put to rest the worn-out movie clichés that just need to go away. We expect Hollywood to take note and change their upcoming slate of films accordingly.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Over the last decade, the internet has brought into public light some of the great social injustices hiding just beneath the surface of what we thought we knew about our society...or specifically what white men thought they knew about society. No topic – from abuse of police power to campaign finance reform – has been without vocal opposition from both sides of the issue.Yet one topic seems especially inflammatory, as it's been both helped and hindered by the very mechanism of the internet itself: sexism and sexual violence. Yes, Bill Cosby's victims were empowered by the medium and momentum to come forward and name their abuser. But dig deeper and a similar controversy sits quietly on the backburner as people refuse to name names and victims refuse to come forward, fearing public shaming and career endangerment.This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien speaks with Cracked columnist Adam Tod Brown and comedian Dani Fernandez about the unseen difficulties faced by women in the internet age, the powers that try to silence female voices both online and in the real world, and why these issues are magnified in the comedy community.Go download the Howl app or go to  Howl.FM  and use the promo code CRACKED for a free one month trial of Howl Premium!</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Here's a potentially scary statistic: Of the 330 people freed by the Innocence Project, an organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted prisoners, 10% of them actually admitted to committing the crime they were innocent of. They even estimate that as many as 5% of all prisoners in America are innocent. That may seem like a low percentage, but that's tens or hundreds of thousands of people in jail right now who committed no crime.In the age of DNA testing, facial recognition software and the deputization of every person with a smartphone camera and a YouTube account, it's actually barbaric the ease with which we send people to prison without really knowing for sure if they're guilty or just had bad lawyers. We like to think that by comparing the technologies we have now to the primitive science and guesswork of 100 years ago that we're actually really good at solving crimes and putting the real bad guys away, but that's not the case. DNA science isn't nearly as exact as we think it is, and the criminal justice system is built more for quickly shuffling suspects to prison than actually solving crimes.This week on the podcast Jack O'Brien is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to discuss how far we've come as a species in the way we try to solve crimes, the areas we're still woefully bad at it, and how society's earliest mistakes still color the messed up way in which we view and prosecute right versus wrong.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>If you turn on the TV or scroll through Facebook for any short period of time, it seems like we're consumed with fear. There's always a new airborne virus or a new piece of legislature destined to sink the country into Purge-like anarchy, not to mention the sharks, snakes and spiders that have been trying to kill us for millennia.It's easy to place the blame on media in the 21st century, but fear mongering is no recent addition to the human experience. You can go back through history and trace all sorts of fears through the written word. Where now our movies depict zombies, alien invasions and nuclear wars, medieval literature spoke of demons, hellfire and apocalypse scenarios more fitting to the times.This week Jack O'Brien is joined by Kristi Harrison and Michael Swaim to tackle everything related to how we experience fear in the 21st century: what fears we can blame on evolution and what fears we can blame on society, whether it's true to say we're more afraid now than ever before and what our most common fears say about us as a species.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Think about every time a movie villain asks the hero something like, "you and what army?" You know what happens next: a door opens, a roof explodes, or the camera pushes out the window to show, you guessed it, our hero's army. Maybe it's the rest of the Avengers, maybe an actual army, or maybe just our hero's muscle.It's a clever reveal in the moment, but think about it realistically. Does that mean if Tony Stark is chatting with Loki and that moment is about to happen, are the rest of the Avengers just hiding in a lobby somewhere waiting for their cue? Maybe they're in a broom closet, ears pressed to the door. What if no one asks, "you and what army?" Is there a contingency plan for dramatically revealing yourself?Every movie is full of logic gaps like these where, for the sake of time or dramatic tension or comedy, the audience is spared the mundane or absurd reality of a situation. This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Tom Reimann to discuss 6 observational pet peeves that will change how you watch all movies.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>A frequent topic on this podcast is the way all movies follow the same structure and how our brains are trained to look for these common rules. Whether it's Die Hard  or Star Wars or The Godfather, all movies follow the same relatively specific beats. If they don't, we usually end up feeling short shrifted or confused. That's why a filmmaker like Terrence Malick can be so frustrating to audiences.But how does this apply to TV, a medium where outside of the half-hour or hour-long time  constraints, a premise could conceivably last for tens or hundreds of hours? How do you maintain and break expectations in a world where the Simpsons need to face a new conflict every week for 30 years? Rules, that's how!This week on the podcast, special guest host Dan O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Soren Bowie and Alex Schmidt to discuss the secret rulebooks that kept the Looney Toons and Community afloat, and how applying strict guidelines to TV shows both maintains their continuity and keeps them watchable.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>The recent tragedy in Charleston, SC sparked, among other things, another flurry of debate in what appears to be our new twisted national pastime: arguing about guns. We'll hear in the media proposed solutions to the problem of gun violence in America, and we'll also hear the realities of why they wont work. We'll hear about magazine restrictions and closing the gun show loophole, but we'll also hear about how gun ownership is a tradition and a hobby across America that would be as easy to prohibit tomorrow as it would be to prohibit driving a car or owning a boat.The gun debate is a nuanced, complex issue with elaborate roots that stretch back generations. This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Josh Sargent to discuss both sides of the gun debate, the statistics about gun violence that you almost never hear, how the debate is painted by race, how gun ownership is more deeply rooted in a person's identity than we think, and how trying to predict the next mass shooter will always be impossible.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Last year, of the ten highest grossing films at the American box office, nine were adaptations of one of the following: a Marvel property, a Disney property, a line of toys or a fantasy novel. You could easily guess what movies these were – your X-Men, your Hobbits, your Legos and Transformers – but what was that one outlier, that one movie that didn't fit the mold of mass-produced comic book movies or animated films? That movie was in fact the highest grossing film  of last year, and it was an adaptation itself, 'American Sniper.'As you would assume, 'American Sniper' wasn't the runaway hit overseas as it was in the States, but neither were the rest of the films from the American top 10. Every major foreign market only featured a small handful of American blockbusters in their top 10. The rest of the spots in each country went to smaller adult comedies and dramas, the types of movies we almost never see atop our box office. Why is that, and where are those movies in America? It feels like we're told in the US that the reason we only have blockbuster movies here is because the rest of the world craves big, American spectacle. Then why does it feel like our main exports are comic book movies that half of the world doesn't even really want to see?This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors David Bell and Josh Sargent to discuss the seeming disparity between the size and the quality of modern-day blockbusters, their effectiveness internationally, and how the process of developing movies has changed over the last hundred years.Go to   parachutehome.com/cracked  and Parachute will give you $25 off on your first order with promo code cracked.</itunes:summary>

Some of the song loops from Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog are only around a minute long, yet they never annoy or distract as you try to finish a level. The brain does weird things in response to repetition. As you'll hear in the episode, a UCSD professor found that if you hear a repeating loop of almost any series of spoken words, your mind will begin to hear that input as music.This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Dan O'Brien and Alex Schmidt to discuss how the human mind seeks out repetition, turns that repetition into music, and how video games have turned this science into an unsung art form.Go to   parachutehome.com/cracked  and Parachute will give you $25 off on your first order with promo code cracked.</itunes:summary>

He walks the streets with ease and beats up thugs with horrifying proficiency, why the need for the standard film and television signifiers that yes, he is indeed a blind man?Can't characters be blind, be handicapped, be gay, be Jamaican, be anything other than straight white American men without writers or directors or costume designers slapping the easiest, most stereotypical labels on them?This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Josh Sargent to talk about the pitfalls of this cinematic shorthand, how certain movie stereotypes unknowingly misrepresent the people they try to epitomize, and why even "a good stereotype," is still wildly reductive of an entire population of people.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>In his new column going up tomorrow, David Wong uses the hilariously outdated Billy Joel song 'We Didn't Start The Fire' to illustrate a confounding problem with dominant white and western culture. The song chronologically lists everything that's gone wrong in the world from 1949 to 1989 in between choruses of "We didn't start the fire," meaning, "Hey, it's not my fault that the world is so fucked up."It's a common and understandable knee-jerk reaction for people in the 21st century to think that just because they were born in the 1980s, or that their grandparents didn't come to America until the 20th century, that they're not responsible for something like slavery. Yes, it's true that you're not individually to blame for slavery, but you still may reap countless invisible benefits from being a white male in the 21st century that you just don't get if you're African-American, or from a poor family, or a woman. There's an endless context to complicated social matters that doesn't just begin or end with, "I didn't start the fire."That was just one example of the ways in which many people are blind to the historical context in which we live–that every moment in the present is either consciously or subconsciously tied to the entire history of our species. This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by David Wong (aka Jason Pargin) and Josh Sargent to discuss these historical blindspots and how they're being slowly eroded by the human progress of the last two centuries.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>In 1848, on the eve of the California Gold Rush, there were less than 1000 white settlers living in the California territory. Within the next 2 years, that number would jump up to 100,000, making it the largest mass-migration in US history. In the early 1920s, the film industry would create a 2nd and more lasting population boom in California, as throngs of hopefuls moved cross-country to become rich and famous movie stars. By 1962, California was the most populous state in the union.The state now balances on a curious precipice. California produces a majority of the country's fruits, vegetables and nuts, yet is in the midst of a drought that's turning one region into a poisonous dust-bowl. The libertarian pot-farmers of the north use 8% of the state's electricity, yet are trying to secede and form their own state. San Francisco has been entirely taken over by the tech industry's wealthy and the city's tradition of taking care of its lowest class is falling by the wayside. Los Angeles has been a smog-riddled nightmare from the fever-dreams of John Carpenter ever since the auto industry deliberately razed the public transportation system. And an Austrian-sounding robot sent from the future to destroy humanity served as governor for 8 years.This week, we give Florida a break and take a look at the dark history of the Golden State. Jack O'Brien is joined by Cracked editors Dan O'Brien and Robert Evans as they discuss the state's unexpectedly high murder rate, its burgeoning marijuana industry, and why, since 1848, it's seduced millions into thinking they can get rich quick.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Dave Barry spent over 20 years of his life writing a nationally syndicated humor column every single week like clockwork. Over that span, he appeared in over 500 newspapers, wrote 30 books and won a Pulitzer Prize. And while he's now technically retired from his column at the Miami Herald, he still publishes books every year at the same clip.Now we live in a different world for humor writing. While the best comedians write for television and give away half of their jokes for free on Twitter, Dave is one of the last colossi of a fading art, whose influence on comedy and this very website is unmistakable.Cracked editors Jack O'Brien and Soren Bowie sit down for a long-form conversation with Dave about his new book, Live Right And Find Happiness (Although Beer is Much Faster), how he managed to find inspiration for his weekly column, the relationship between comedy and free speech, and the irrefutable weirdness of Florida.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>If you recall the 2006 movie 'The Prestige,' you'll remember the plot roughly follows how two Batmen fight an army of Wolverines created by David Bowie. Look it up. The most overlooked part of the film is when Nikola Tesla (played by Bowie) invents a freaking cloning machine and then sort of disappears because the movie needs to be wrapped up by the two-hour mark.What happens to Tesla? Where's the Tesla v. Edison sequel where Tesla is the most powerful man on Earth because he invents cloning in the late-1800s?This week on the podcast, recorded live at the UCB Sunset Theatre in Los Angeles, Jack O'Brien, Michael Swaim, Dan O'Brien, and Soren Bowie discuss 'The Prestige,' 'Wall-E,' the 'Indiana Jones' franchise and a number of other films with awesome sequels that don't exist, but should.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>The entertainment industry has a great way of being subtly racist while proclaiming their open-mindedness. Case in point: the Sony email hack revealed the studio didn't pursue a sequel to the Denzel Washington film 'The Equalizer' because "the international motion picture audience is racist." No, not America, we solved that whole racism thing, it's the rest of the world that's racist.Look at the triumph of new network shows like 'Empire' and 'Black-ish.' The media decries their success as random or flukey when actually there's a much simpler and less demeaning explanation for their accomplishments: people want to watch shows about the African-American experience and it's a market that's vastly under-served.This week on the podcast, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien sits down for 3 conversations about the racist stuff in pop-culture that white people just don't see. First, he is joined by Kevin Avery of 'Last Week Tonight' and 'Denzel Washington is the Greatest Actor of All Time Period,' then he hops on the phone with Kid Fury and Crissle West from 'The Read,' and wraps up with a conversation with 'Yo Is This Racist?' host Andrew Ti.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Pop quiz, hotshot. Did you know that 'Speed', the Keanu-on-a-bus 90s action tent-pole was originally developed as a completely different film? At first, the script was written as an ensemble drama about a cast of strangers on a bus working together to stop a terrorist, but once Keanu signed on, it was rewritten as the fast and dumb classic we know and love today.So many huge Hollywood films have little-known stories like these, where one decision changes the entire film and the lives of everyone involved. In other cases, these stories don't provide an alternate history as much as they provide a new context that makes re-watching the film a completely different experience.This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by Earwolf's Matt Gourley to discuss some of the stories unearthed from his podcast 'I Was There Too' and then chats with Cracked editor David Christopher Bell about overlooked behind the scenes stories from the films of David O. Russell, Stanley Kubrick and more.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Anthropomorphic goatee and director of 'The Jinx' Andrew Jarecki has recently taken criticism from many sides regarding the ending of his documentary series. Some condemn the way he sat on critical evidence and withheld it from the police, while others criticize how he inserts himself into the story of 'The Jinx' and how its final episode fraudulently plays with chronology. But if Robert Durst goes to prison, do the ends justify the means?Other popular documentaries have an even less legitimate relationship with the truth. Morgan Spurlock's results from 'Super Size Me' haven't been able to be replicated; 'Searching for Sugarman' conveniently leaves out that Rodriguez knew he was world famous in a number of other countries; and 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is basically pure propaganda, yet their entertainment value is undeniable and carries weight despite these criticisms.This week on the podcast, Jack O'Brien is joined by editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Josh Sargent to talk about the recent documentary boom and some of the genre's most popular entries from the last 10 years. They have a spoiler-filled discussion about 'Serial' and 'The Jinx', talk through the tricks documentarians use to manipulate truth, and whether their ultimate obligation should be to honesty or entertainment.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Here are two scenarios that might properly contextualize Harrison Ford in light of his recent plane crash into a Santa Monica golf course:One. He's Hollywood's Mr. Magoo: a hapless, sensory-challenged old man who creates a chain reaction of havoc and destruction with every misplaced step he takes.Two. He's Wile E. Coyote. His dream job is actually to be a pilot, so he chases that dream (Road Runner) at every chance he gets, using exceedingly shoddy 1940s era machinery and avionics, only to wind up, yet again, in a full-body cast.Do we know anything about Harrison Ford or what drives him? No. Does Harrison Ford listen to podcasts? Probably not. Has he torn his ACL twice while acting? You bet he has. And that's all we need for this week's episode, wherein Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined by Soren Bowie and Kristi Harrison to talk about some celebrity pet theories that explain their lunatic behavior.They discuss Harrison Ford's aforementioned plane crash and how it relates to Bruce Willis' strange music career, how Garth Brooks is either the world's greatest diva or the universe's least humanoid space alien, and then discuss theories on the deaths of Whitney Houston and Elvis Presley.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>We know it's old news already, but last week when that blue/black/white/gold dress tore the internet and countless marriages apart, it brought up a theme that we like to talk about a lot at Cracked: how our senses are about as trustworthy as Brian Williams' war memoirs.No, it's true. We've even covered on the podcast before that your brain has as many nerves feeding information out to your eyes as your eyes have feeding information back. In other words, a lot of what you rely on as your vision is really just your brain filling in gaps because it's too lazy to do the rest of the work.Co-hosts Jack O'Brien and Michael Swaim are joined this week by executive editor Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), and use the frenzy over 'the dress' to dive into a conversation about perception, consciousness and the harm of saying, "I'll believe it when I see it."</itunes:summary>

Why does every post-apocalypse just look like a dirty Los Angeles when the present-day hovels in India, China, and Brazil seem much worse?This week on the podcast, editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined (in-studio!) by editors Kristi Harrison, and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) to discuss how TV and movies have completely shattered our expectations when it comes to how money actually works.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>As we've previously covered on the site, before JK Rowling had even finished the 'Harry Potter' books, an interesting fan theory started popping up on Potterverse fansites. The speculation went that perhaps the chosen one wasn't our boy Harry, but actually lovable dunce Neville Longbottom, and that all the whole 'Harry is chosen one' nonsense was Dumbledore intentionally misdirecting he-who-shall-not-be-typed.Whether or not Rowling had planned this, we all know what we got in the end: another textbook hero's journey that would've made Joseph Campbell proud. But isn't that first theory a lot cooler? We think so.Outside-of-the-box fan theories like this are what we're discussing on the podcast this week. We cover a range of pop culture from movie franchises like 'Star Wars' and 'Harry Potter' to the indelible black mark on the internet: Rebecca Black's 'Friday.' Recorded live at the San Diego Comedy Festival, cohosts Jack O'Brien and Michael Swaim are joined by Soren Bowie, Adam Tod Brown, Cody Johnston, Dan O'Brien, and Alex Schmidt.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>We've all heard about the butterfly effect: a butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world, and weeks later that results in a hurricane somewhere else. But that doesn't actually happen, right?We can't prove that a butterfly can affect the weather, but we certainly can tell you that the weather affects us in huge ways. It's been proven that sunny weather yields a good day for the stock market, and that a rainy election day typically results in a Republican win. So maybe that imaginary butterfly has a bigger grasp on our lives than we think.This week on the podcast, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined by Michael Swaim and Dan O'Brien to discuss some examples of this very phenomenon and show how the tiniest of mistakes can change the course of history.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Here's the easiest experiment in the world. Go to YouTube. Click on ANY video. Scroll to the comments. How long did it take you to find a comment that was the most horrible and vile combination of words you've ever seen? If it took longer than 2 seconds, you really weren't trying hard enough.Internet commenters! Trolls! Gross men's rights groups! Your weird aunt on Facebook who doesn't think the moon landing happened! You don't know a single one of these people in real life (other than your aunt) but they seem to make up 75% of the population whenever you go onto the internet. How does that happen? What has made the internet, the ultimate technology to make speech truly free, into this school-yard full of bullies and uninformed people shouting into empty rooms?This week on the podcast, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined by editors Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) and Tom Reimann to try and answer these questions. They theorize on why the loudest people on the internet are so over-represented, and how the un-moderated nature of the internet and social media might be limiting free speech more than we even realize.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>In the last two weeks, the internet was blessed with new trailers for both 'Ant-Man' and 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. Frames were analyzed, Hulks were busted, and lids were flipped. For millions of people, no international tragedies or disasters could compare with the latest news from Marvel's explosion-dense Verse. And we're not even getting into the shrieking excitement that already surrounds the latest Star Wars movie.As crazy as it seems, reports indicate that there are perhaps hundreds of movies coming out this year that don't feature Stan Lee cameos or Jedi. Perhaps this year's 'Edge of Tomorrow' is hiding somewhere and we can't see it through the fog of discussion surrounding hilted lightsabers. The big blockbusters of the year have a way of drowning out everything else, but that doesn't mean there aren't filmmakers doing some seriously cool things in 2015.This week, Cracked editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien is joined by Alisha Grauso from Moviepilot.com, Drew McWeeny from HitFix.com, and Scott Mendelson from Forbes.com to discuss some of the box office and filmmaking trends that we're moving towards in 2015. They'll cover the year's most anticipated movies that AREN'T sequels or comic book movies, and that don't involve so much as a single dinosaur. Crazy, we know.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Last year, Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' took advantage of some of the most up-to-date quantum theory we've got, and wove in a story about space travel, time, and relativity. While that movie went out of its way to include actual science, others just happen upon quantum theory accidentally. Take 'The Empire Strikes Back'-- Luke trains with Yoda for what seems like months in the entire time it takes Han to get through one warp-speed chase. Some might call it a plot hole, but actually could the better explanation be that Luke and Yoda were on a planet that experienced time differently?This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O'Brien, Michael Swaim, and Soren Bowie explain in layman's terms some of the basic paradoxes and thought experiments that have come to define quantum theory, and then apply quantum physics to popular movie plot holes.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>If you had to guess what the average Death Star employee was like, and you could only watch the 'Star Wars' movies, you'd assume it was filled with only two types of people: stormtroopers, and old British men in small hats. Where are the engineers, the janitors, the scientists, the cooks, and the thousands of other people required to maintain a station the size of a moon? And if these people exist, they surely must be paid well considering the risk of going to a workplace so frequently destroyed by rebels.Countless evil organizations from LexCorp to Cobra to the Foot Clan must secretly be great employers to attract a never-ending supply of employees ready to do their bidding.On this week's live podcast from the Comikaze Expo, the cast and writers of After Hours (Jack O'Brien, Michael Swaim, Soren Bowie, Dan O'Brien, Katie Willert, and Cody Johnston) brainstorm and take audience suggestions for an upcoming episode of the show. The subject: great and/or terrible fictional workplaces.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>The end of the year brings two things: unrealistic resolutions sobbed out through mouthfuls of pie, and top ten lists from every site on the Internet. You can't reach January 1st without learning every hack writer's opinion of the best movies, albums, and TV shows from the last 12 months. Experiment time: Google a list of the top 10 films from 2004. You either wont recognize half of movies, or you'll find yourself wondering what drugs the writer was on to include "Mr. 3000" and leave out "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."We are terrible at perspective. Things like the Ebola scare or the Sony hack seem nightmarish in their moment, but they fade to the back of our minds as soon as the next awful thing comes about. The fact that next year's Exploding Testicle Flu and Bill Murray email hack will both be much more shocking won't stop either of these from making it into the top ten most important stories this year. If there's one thing new media excels at, it's turning molehills into goddamn Matterhorns.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>No matter how cool, young or hip you are, eventually the world of mass media will leave your increasingly-saggy ass behind. Recently, the YouTube channel of PewDiePie, a Swedish video game commenter, became the most viewed YouTube channel in history with over 6.6 billion views. The Wall Street Journal cites that PewDiePie makes around $4 million a year from ads sold on his YouTube account. In the Cracked offices, this feat was met with responses like, "what the hell is PewDiePie," "I've lost faith in society," and, "I have no idea what any of those words mean." We’re old -- not ‘discounts at The Sizzler’ old, but old enough that we’re no longer the gatekeepers of popular culture.Tragically (for us) and normally (for everyone else), pop culture is moving faster than ever: YouTubers are making millions; things that some of us were too old for originally, like Power Rangers, are being rebooted; and 13-year-olds seem to have legitimate grounds to bemoan "kids these days."This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O'Brien, Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), Soren Bowie, and Tom Reimann discuss the specific areas of pop culture that seem to have left them behind. This episode is sponsored by  Squarespace  and  R&R Games.

              <itunes:summary>Lately, you can't swing an undead cat without hitting the end of the world. Whether it's the pure escapism of 'The Walking Dead' or high art like 'The Road', every story hits the same beats: it's every man for himself against the hoard of zombies or cannibals or nuclear Nazi mutants, and the only ones who survive are the badasses with shotguns willing to shoot their best friends for a Pop Tart. Even your general post-apocalyptic dystopia movies fall in the same lazy traps -- every city looks like a warehouse or a desert, not because it's an accurate depiction of such a society, but because they're cheaper to film in. But whether it's a case of art reflecting society or storytellers accidentally tapping into a human desire -- and running with it until it's as bloated and decayed as their crew of extras -- it says something about us that's pretty uncomfortable to think about. The apocalypse is just the new Old West, but instead of conquering the "savages," we just revel in being way better at savagery. We like the idea of the fall of civilization because it allows us to elevate basic human decency to heroic decency, and escape the complications of the modern world -- even if most of us would die without it. But that’s why every disaster in the history of ever has shown that it doesn’t play out that way at all. This week, Cracked editors Jack O'Brien, Soren Bowie, and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss the rote ways in which apocalypse movies and TV shows always get the demise of civilization wrong.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>When the founders of OkCupid started one of the most popular dating sites on the Internet, they didn't intend to find out all of humanity's deep, dark secrets. All they wanted was to help people make babies. However, they accidentally ended up with a treasure trove of information about the difference between what people say (and even think) about themselves and what they actually do – and you won't like it. By analyzing the language and behavior of OkCupid users, they've determined that you're probably a lot more racist than you think, and you can actually guess someone's race with a stunning degree of accuracy based on what they care about. (It involves lumberjack music festivals.) You're also probably a lot gayer, unless you actually label yourself as bisexual. The Internet as a whole is rife with this data -– you can even track the voting results for the 2008 election by mapping which areas of the country Googled racist jokes. But you shouldn't be afraid of leaving these trails of data, because it means that in the future, history will no longer be written by the winners, and every one of us is a potential Anne Frank. This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O'Brien, Michael Swaim and Alex Schmidt are joined by one of the cofounders of OkCupid, Christian Rudder, to discuss his recent book, Dataclysm, and how the 21st century will be defined by the enormous amounts of data that can be found by digging through your virtual trash.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Hollywood never fails to remind us that we only use 10% of our brains. That statistic is bullshit, but it's true that around 90% of the activity in our brains is completely unconscious. We make most of our decisions without even knowing it. Our brains are constantly making decisions for us before we even know it, and it's our conscious mind that fills in the rest of the details, crafting this decision into a narrative. That's how a guy like Dennis Rodman could know where every ball was going to go as soon as it left a player's hand -- it's also how most racism happens, and the reason why "when the judge ate last" is the best predictor of how he'll rule. This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O'Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss the conscious and unconscious sides of human decision-making, how they're tied together, and the unexpected biases they produce. They'll also talk with writer and improvisational comedian Ali Farahnakian to learn how these theories can be applied to comedy. Listen now to get some solid advice on improvisational humor -- and to learn why your political preferences might be less the result of your own decisions than of how your brain is hardwired.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>'Historical fiction' is almost always more of the latter than the former: so much history just doesn't look very interesting onscreen. But our passion for only the screen-friendly bits of the past means we often wind up with a much more boring and less accurate mental image of historic events. Any WWII film set in Germany paints all the people as part of a hive mind set on world domination. But what if we told you the National Socialist Party never won a single election with more than 42% of the vote? The real Nazi party was much smaller than we tend to remember -- but it was also way crazier. From Hitler’s nerdy obsession with fantasy books to Himmler's attempts to resurrect the dead, the Third Reich was much LARP-ier than you've been lead to expect. This week, Jack O'Brien, Soren Bowie, Michael Swaim, Robert Evans and JF Sargent talk about the flip sides to well-known historic moments that Hollywood left out. We'll also talk about 'Little House on the Prairie', the TV show and set of children books about a little family that could out on the American frontier. The one thing Laura Ingalls Wilder left out is that her next door neighbors at the time were a family of crazed cannibal serial killers. Would you like to know more?

              <itunes:summary>We all have addicts in our lives -- that friend or relative who fell prey to alcohol, heroin or some other drug. Nobody pretends those aren't "real" addictions. But when a D-list reality star checks in to rehab for porn addiction or a major study warns of smartphone addiction, we roll our eyes. If an obese person claims they're addicted to eating, we tsk their lack of self-control. Why isn't every addiction created equal in the court of public opinion? Compulsive smartphone use doesn't have the same consequences as smoking crack, but 'Candy Crush' still makes use of the same addictive feedback loop. Whether you're gambling or eating Cheetos, you're trading your time and money in exchange for regular hits of dopamine. This week on the podcast, Cracked editors Jack O'Brien and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss the science and culture of addiction in the 21st century. They'll look at all the ways giant corporations are exploiting our brains to control our behavior -- and ask if there's any way this addiction train can be stopped.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>We love babies, and we’re also horrified by all that they imply. Babies can’t eat on their own or hold their heads up, and they go to the bathroom in their pants like drunken little monsters. But science is beginning to show that there may be a lot more going on in their heads than we had previously thought. Scientists have found that babies are surprisingly good at emotional manipulation. Even more frightening,they’ve found evidence of racism in babies. It gets crazier: the very scent of a baby is a powerful drug with mind-altering effects on their parent’s brains. In a live taping at the LA Podfest, Cracked writers Jack O’Brien, Dan O’Brien, Soren Bowie and Michael Swaim discuss the weird things we don’t know about the psychology and physiology of babies. Did you know babies have extra bones? Or that babies from different countries cry in different languages?

              <itunes:summary>You may be the first to admit that your Facebook page is simply a highlight reel of your life -- a carefully collected stream of only the best pictures, moments, and one-liners -- but why is it hard to make that same realization about the lives of everyone else? Why do we assume Japan is a nuthouse of tentacle porn and horrifying game shows, even though all the weird American porn and TV doesn’t make our nation a typhoon of madness? That's sampling bias, homies! The same way the local news only reports the one study that “proves” Aspartame causes cancer but ignores all of the studies that say it doesn't. Our brain does this to us all day. Other people’s brains do it to us, too. If you think Russia is basically ‘Mad Max’ with Snow, 24/7, it’s because your picture of Russia comes from the craziest dash-cam videos a few Russians managed to upload. On today’s podcast, Cracked editors Jack O'Brien, Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), and Alex Schmidt sit down for a podcast about the unexpected sampling errors that populate our life. Throw on your headphones and click play above to hear us explain why the world we think we live in may not exist at all.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>Hollywood’s villains are the luckiest people on the damn planet. Let's talk about climactic midpoint of The Dark Knight: The Joker stages an assassination attempt forcing Batman, but not actually Batman, to reveal his true identity just for the purpose of getting caught later, then forcing Batman Batman to choose between Rachel and Harvey Dent, who are rigged to perfectly timed bombs in warehouses somehow 20 minutes away from any police presence. How in the world did he plan all of that by himself and know it would all be timed perfectly!? What are all of the steps that the Joker would have to go through to ensure all of these events happened with Swiss precision? The weirdness goes beyond intelligent villains. How does the asteroid in Armageddon know to target our most famous buildings? In Friday the 13th, Part 2, how the hell did Jason Voorhees track down his victim’s house without a map, or a goddamn car? This week, on a very special LIVE podcast from Zanies in Nashville, Cracked's Jack O'Brien, Jason Pargin (aka David Wong), Michael Swaim, Soren Bowie, and Cody Johnson are joined by the Cinema Sins guys (Jeremy Scott and Chris Atkinson) to discuss some major plot holes from their favorite blockbuster movies.</itunes:summary>

              <itunes:summary>You're on the 1970s game show "Let's Make a Deal," and you get to pick between 3 doors: behind one is a new car, and behind the other two are gag prizes. After choosing your door, the host shows you one of the doors the car is NOT behind and asks if you'd like to change your pick to the only other remaining door. What do you do? Common sense would prove that the host removing a door from contention has no effect. You had a 33% chance of winning a car and now you have a 50% chance. But what if we told you, by switching your decision, your chances of winning a car would go up to 66%? You would tell us to take high school statistics over again, but you'd be wrong. Today on the podcast Jack O'Brien, Dan O'Brien, and Jason Pargin (aka David Wong) discuss some of the more deceiving statistics in our world that prove that common sense is worthless and our brains are horrible at math.  This episode is sponsored by: Squarespace: Build a better website.
